how a shadow is made a light nose on a big object#L-E
rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms#L-E
the order of colors in the rainbow goes red orange yellow green blue indigo violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave#L-E
this is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye#L-E
its the same with magenta except blue red nonces off#L-E
its also the same with cyan except blue green light bounces off#L-E
shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow the shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object#L-E
it depends on the time of day for the size of the shadow#L-E
a convex lens also helps focus the light#L-E
it dost focus the light#L-E
if you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water#L-E
wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose#L-E
wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow the blue is absorbed and you cant see it#L-E
other lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow#L-E
a liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth#L-E
light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves#L-E
light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line it was proved by many people a long time ago#L-E
a shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow#L-E
solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on#L-E
you have three eye cones in your eyes to see different couplers like i said before the easy way to se many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green#L-E
glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work#L-E
a shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object to see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red#L-E
this is how a shadow is made a shadow is made when light hits an object#L-E
this is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow#L-E
how we make a rainbow with rain after it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow#L-E
solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy#L-E
my theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves#L-E
my theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light#L-E
the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits#L-E
my understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest#L-E
anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected#L-E
rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops the raindrops acts as prisms#L-E
other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction#L-E
if you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came#L-E
i learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth#L-E
a shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow#L-E
i also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity#L-E
the northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth#L-E
if you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green#L-E
if you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected#L-E
when you see a rainbow you only see half of it a rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see#L-E
if you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black#L-E
fluorescence objects are glow in the dark objects a sea animal that lives under the water is glow in the dark and glow in the dark star stickers and bandages fluorescence objects are made be friction like two rocks rubbing together#L-E
a lunar eclipse is when the moon covers the sun long time ago a man predicted that there would be a lunar eclipse and he was right#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the sun covers the moon#L-E
my understanding about shadows is that when light hits you it creates a shadow my theory is that the light hits you and goes around you to make a shadow heres a picture to make it more simple#L-E
also they react like chemiluminescence witch is a process of changing chemic energy into light energy#L-E
solar panels absorb sun light rays and turn them into energy#L-E
to reflect colors the object has to be the same color to reflect the light colorto absorb light color the object has to be not the same color to be absorb#L-E
i think that light travels in straight lines and some other people think that light travels in waves i also think that light is a wave but it travels in straight lines i think light travels in straight lines in two ways#L-E
a rainbows are made by raindrops that act like a prism that make the rainbow#L-E
if you look at a green apple for a long time the green cone gets tired but the red and blue are not tired and together red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite color of green#L-E
most things that glow have some fluorescent paint on them this paint absorbs light and then glows until it has no more light absorbed in it#L-E
a shadow is made when darkness made when light shines on a opaque object#L-E
a liner eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the moon is between the sun and the earth#L-E
a shadow is made when a light source hits an object#L-E
a lunar eclipse is when the sun foe between the moon and casts a shadow#L-E
i need to understand why you can get two different kinds of shadows one that is larger than you and one that is smaller than you my theory of what happens is that it appends on the time of day#L-E
what helps things that glow are fluorescence pink and other colors#L-E
if your body wants to see a red rose the red is bounced into your eyes and the other colors are absorbs#L-E
if your body wants to see a yellow green and red is bounced into you eyes and the blue is absorbed#L-E
solar panels takes in light and makes it in to energy#L-E
my understanding shadows starts at the shadow view if a light sours hits a optic nontransparent object which creates a shadow such as a person is standing behind a light sours and a shadow papers behind them#L-E
rain can can be used as prisms thats why theres a rainbow after it rains#L-E
a solar panel absorbs light and uses it as energy#L-E
fireflies produce light from their abdominals because of a chemical reaction caused by lucifer and lucifer this is called photoluminescence#L-E
this is how a glow stick works when you snap a glow stick it makes a little hole and to chemicals collide and then they glow this is called chemiluminescence#L-E
a shadow is made by standing in front of a light source and then the place you block up is where the shadow is made#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the moon passes in between the sun and the earth causing a big shadow#L-E
i thought glow in the dark could only happen with one thine but then i read yasmin note and saw that it happens with three things heat friction and electricity#L-E
in the shadows view i learned the closer the sun is to you the stronger it is#L-E
also i learned that your body blocked the sun and that creates a shadow the sun goes through the ground and makes a shadow for a root#L-E
a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside#L-E
we see a red rose because the primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off#L-E
we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off#L-E
a shadow is the darkness left behind when a light sours shines on a nontransparent object#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the moon blocks the sun light from coming to the earth#L-E
a lunar clips is when the sun blocks the moons light from going to earth#L-E
you can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain rain is what make the rainbow in the sky#L-E
solar panels are panels that use light to make electricity#L-E
all we see is light without light we can not see#L-E
we can see a yellow rose because red blue and green are going to the flower red and green bounce into your eyes but blue absorbs#L-EE
you can see a red rose because red bounces of and goes into your eyes blue and green get absorbed#L-EE
when you see a red flower the red light bounces off the flower in to our eyes and the green blue gets absorbed#L-EE
when you shine a light through a glass prism it ell make a rainbow on the surface it needs to be white light of the colors light wail be to strong and wont split up into the rainbow#L-EE
this is how absorbing and reflecting works the colors that make the object will be reflected and the leftover color will be wasted not used#L-EE
a shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream the light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark#L-EE
my theory is that light travels in waves i leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light#L-EE
most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger#L-EE
if light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red#L-EE
but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black#L-EE
what is absorbing my understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white red green and blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed#L-EE
what is reflecting my understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed why i think there reflected is because its not the same color#L-EE
this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way#L-EE
new information a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness#L-EE
a solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what i just told you#L-EE
the way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green what happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed#L-EE
with a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray#L-EE
the northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun the particles are so small you couldn't see them how they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow#L-EE
convex mirrors are used in stores they let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle#L-EE
all we see is light the way i can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color then the color bounces into your eye three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color#L-EE
i just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon the earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon#L-EE
this is how rainbows are made with rain the sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow#L-EE
i think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly#L-EE
if you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface the color red is reflected but the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red#L-EE
my understanding about a lunar eclipse is that when the earth is between the sun and the moon the sun casts a shadow over the moon called a lunar eclipse#L-EE
my theory's that light travels in a wave line because if you drive behind a bus you'll see heat that looks wave#L-EE
shadows a shadow is an inexact reflection of your body that shows on a very sunny day when you are outside you see your shadow when you happen to be outside and you look down at the ground also your shadow touches you wherever you touch the ground#L-EE
we see a red rose when there is a flashlight or another light source that will shine on the rose and absorb the green and blue light and reflect the red light into our eyes#L-EE
and how we see a yellow rose is that it is the same but the red and green light are reflected and blue is absorbed#L-EE
how do you make a rainbow with rain the sky is still wet with raindrops and the sunlight shines through the drops and a rainbow forms in the sky make a rainbow with a prism exactly the same way#L-EE
the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis and they are lights in the sky that are mixtures of colors that are seen only in the northern parts of the world and that is why they are called the northern lights#L-EE
why are northern lights different colors each gas in earths atmosphere glows with its own color when it becomes charged with electricity oxygen gives off an eerie green glow nitrogen glows red and neon gas turns pink#L-EE
i also learned that a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun which makes a large shadow over the earth that is why when your outside and the sun dispersals its just a large shadow#L-EE
i also learned that a lunar eclipse is caused when the earth is between the sun and the moon#L-EE
also if your looking at a yellow flower the blue light would be absorbed allowing the two other colors to both making yellow would bounce of into your two sensitive cone to those colors#L-EE
the northern lights are caused by the sun bombarding the earth with tiny partials of electricity when these partials hit the highest part of the hates atmosphere it electrolysis the air and makes it glow#L-EE
to make a rainbow with rain it in voles moisture in the air and since there is moisture in the air the moistness acts like a prism#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is right in between the sun and the moon winch casts a shadow over the moon making the moon total darkness#L-EE
solar panels are used for sucking up sunlight and using the sunlight for something such as a solar powered windmill that works by the sunlight getting sucked into a solar panel and the light moves the windmill#L-EE
a red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed#L-EE
a yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed#L-EE
inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy this energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy the process of giving off light is called incandescence#L-EE
you have three eye cones in your eyes one is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color#L-EE
when we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose#L-EE
my understanding of light the colors of light light is made up of many many different colors you cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light white light is transparent so you cant see it#L-EE
when it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow#L-EE
that is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow#L-EE
there are also things called solar panels they are made to catch light the light that they catch is used to make electricity solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected#L-EE
a shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent when a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow#L-EE
a lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun the sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness#L-EE
a solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark#L-EE
people make shadows by just standing in the light because light travels in a titrate line or waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object#L-EE
shadow my theory is that all the light gets around but it doesn't get past your body so it is dark and the shape of your body#L-EE
a solar eclipse it happens when the moon is located between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the sunlight#L-EE
solar energy solar panels are dark so they attract heat and the sun is turned into thermal energy in the panels there are little tubes and the water gets warmer the warm water is pumped into a storage tank and it heats the house#L-EE
the northern lights are red pink ghostly greens the northern lights happen when the sun bombards earth with particles that are electric when they hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and it glows#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the moon and the sun in which the sun shines on earth and makes a shadow on the moon which makes the moon in total darkness#L-EE
if a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower#L-EE
there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part#L-EF
lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth#L-EF
transparent means full se through so nontransparent means opaque non see through#L-EF
aura borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to france or italy the natives feared them because they thought they were evil things#L-EF
photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light fact over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence#L-EF
photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head#L-EF
those are the colors of your eye cones what i mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the secondary colors#L-EF
the secondary colors of light are made by mixing the primary colors of light here are the secondary colors of light yellow magenta and cyan here is how their made#L-EF
the northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter#L-EF
a transparent object is something you can see though like stephanie light can go right though it#L-EF
a translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light#L-EF
when you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows and the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear#L-EF
if you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue violet and indigo#L-EF
my understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light#L-EF
lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day#L-EF
the law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray#L-EF
its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle#L-EF
convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated#L-EF
i also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent#L-EF
another one of the things i learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time they could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow#L-EF
when light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point#L-EF
lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world it can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything#L-EF
when white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow all the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors#L-EF
chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light i used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence#L-EF
making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out an example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining#L-EF
when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle#L-EF
a translucent object is not see through that means that you cant look through it but a little light can come through a translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer#L-EF
a concave mirror has a sort of cave shape we have mirrors that are flat the mirror that i am talking about is that mirror but pushed in this mirror looks like a bowl when you look into it you see a long shape of yourself#L-EF
a convex mirror is the very opposite this mirror is pushed out this mirror looks like a belly as we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down#L-EF
concave lens heal near sided people see far sided the light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head#L-EF
lasers are very bright and very strong they can go through anything if you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop#L-EF
to make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light shine all of the colors in the same spot then you will see white light here is a picture to make it more simple#L-EF
light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens whits is called diffused reflection#L-EF
to make a rainbow withs prism is simple just get a prism and go outside then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow but sometimes you can not see all the colors#L-EF
co lours of light you can make white light by mixing red green and blue primary colors of light light together#L-EF
the secondary colors of paint are orange green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other#L-EF
there are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes they are red green and blue they are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta#L-EF
the gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point that point is the meeting place of the light#L-EF
your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness in a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright but at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between#L-EF
the angle incidents equals the angle of reflection#L-EF
a defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror#L-EF
you have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue they are all sensitive to there own colors#L-EF
when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally#L-EF
you have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone the red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light#L-EF
we have 3 different eye cones the 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue#L-EF
a concave mirror looks like a bowl when light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below#L-EF
there is some thing called the law of reflection the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror#L-EF
a diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror its when all the light goes in lots of directions#L-EF
objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous the sun is luminous as well#L-EF
cones are things that respond to colored light there are three kinds of light that cones respond to red blue and green#L-EF
light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light a prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet#L-EF
there are different names for the colors of light those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light there not just named orally the primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors#L-EF
the primary colors are red blue and green the same colors as your eye cones#L-EF
a convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave#L-EF
a concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite#L-EF
a convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you a concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close#L-EF
you can add another lens to one of those lenses also a double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light#L-EF
there are two kinds of light natural and artificial natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs#L-EF
the second thing is fluorescence that is made with friction like when two stones rub together they make fire whits is heat and light that is fluorescence#L-EF
news flash if you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed#L-EF
and umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source that makes a big shadow that is pretty darker#L-EF
a penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source that makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter#L-EF
eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down the image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize#L-EF
fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it all the colors will come out the other side#L-EF
an umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra#L-EF
shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are#L-EF
the rainbow is made up of colored light the colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet#L-EF
there are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue#L-EF
a concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and#L-EF
a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large#L-EF
when colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light#L-EF
sundials are a form of telling time you can tell the time by the position of the shadow#L-EF
shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in#L-EF
a concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused#L-EF
a convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking#L-EF
all of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light#L-F
a transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through#L-F
a translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through#L-F
an opaque object lets 0 through#L-F
the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection#L-F
the secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple#L-F
red and blue make magenta#L-F
blue and green make cyan and#L-F
green and red make yellow#L-F
all three primary colors make white#L-F
light and materials the most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors but first mirrors there are two kinds of mirrors there names are concave and convex#L-F
you cant forget flat mirrors there sort of in the middle flat mirrors are pretty important to#L-F
that law only works for smooth mirrors though#L-F
on bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions that is a called a diffused reflection#L-F
now lenses there are two kinds of lenses concave and convex just like the mirrors they do the same things#L-F
lenses are transparent#L-F
there are two other forms that translucent and opaque#L-F
a transparent object means see through#L-F
a translucent object colors the light and#L-F
an opaque object means that it stops the light completely#L-F
now artificial light first chemiluminescence chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light#L-F
then there are lasers lasers are extremely bright and very strong they can go through anything#L-F
there are two different ways you can play with shadows one is an umbra and the other is a penumbra#L-F
those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things those things are eclipses there are two eclipses that we know of solar and lunar#L-F
3 is it true that we cant see without light of course not#L-F
the colors of light i think are in the rainbow winch are redorangeyellowgreenblueindigoand violet#L-F
the primary colors of pigment paint are bluebeard yellow#L-F
there are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial the kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers#L-F
photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves#L-F

but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when i did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights i didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow#L-EE
when light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror#L-EF
if you use it with aluminum foil thats all crumpled up then light will go out at all sides this is called a diffuse reflection#L-F
there are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror#L-EF

here is how solar panels work dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light the dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy the thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan that means that black attracts heat#L-EE
the colors of light is the rainbow#L-F
this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light the glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall when you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us these 2 things are all plugd into a wall#L-EE
the picture i drew was making a rainbow out of a prism this picture is with two prisms this is how it works if you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again this is how to make white light through a viable spectrum#L-EE

there are 3 different theories about how light effects how we see the two theories are your eyes can adjust to light they cant and you see only the outlines#L-F
my understanding of light in natural and artificial light even though i am a master of that view i know that stars are made of gas not fire i found that interesting because before i read those notes i thought that stars were made of fire and only planets were surrounded by gas#L-F
i also learned lasers can cut through absolutely anything even diamonds#L-F
also i learned that 70 percent of the underwater animals use photoluminescence i also found this interesting fungi and bacteria use photoluminescence#L-F
a umbra is the darker part of the light that you may shine anywhere you see the umbra when the light hits something#L-F
the penumbra is a lot like the umbra but is the lighter part#L-F
in light and materials i know that a transparent object is see through#L-F
a translucent object is sort of see through#L-F
and opaque is non see through#L-F
you can see more in a convex mirror than a concave mirror#L-F
the law of reflection is when the indecent ray hits the flat mirror the reflection ray bounces back#L-F
a diffuse reflection is when light hits a something bumpy and the light goes everywhere#L-F
in co lours of light it talks about the primary colors of light are red blue and green#L-F
and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and cyan#L-F
if you mix the primary colors of light you get white light#L-F
if you shine light through a prism it makes a rainbow#L-F
the northern lights are usually found up north people used to be scared of them#L-F
there are two types of shadows the umbra and the penumbra#L-F
the umbra is a small and dark shadow you will get when you use a small light sours#L-F
the penumbra is a lighter shadow around the umbra you get the penumbra when you use a large light#L-F
you can use shadow to tell time with a sundial#L-F
and the primary colors of paint are red yellow and blue#L-F
the secondary colors of light are yellow cyan and magenta#L-F
the secondary colors of paint are purple orange and green#L-F
you can make white light by mixing red blue and green#L-F
light can be reflected and absorbed#L-F
the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis the aurora borealis is light there are lots of colors in the aurora borealis#L-F
there are 3 ways to describe an object the 3 ways are transparent translucent and opaque#L-F
a transparent object is like glass you can see through it#L-F
a translucent object is an object that is ike sand falling through water light can go through it#L-F
an opaque object is like peter light cant go through him#L-F
a convex mirror looks like the picture above on the right#L-F
a convex lens focuses the light#L-F
a concave lens speeds out the light#L-F
there are 4 come types of luminescences photoluminescence chemiluminescence electro luminescence and thermoluminescence#L-F
things that glow are called fluorescence#L-F
gazers are very strong and used for a lot of things#L-F
my theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line#L-E
shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object if the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror if there is no light there isn't a shadow so there is a shadow where the light cant reach#L-EE
the sun is the most important light source#L-F
objects that don't give off light are non luminous#L-F
a flashlight is luminous when on but is non luminous when switched off#L-F
when an animal gives off its own light its called photoluminescence as in biomasses#L-F
chemiluminescence is produced by certain chemical reactions for example glow sticks#L-F
electro luminescence is produced by electric discharges for example when silk or fur is stroked or when adhesive surfaces are separated#L-F
thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks one of these sources is wintergreen life savers if you are chewing one turn the lights of look in a mirror while chewing look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks#L-EF
a rainbow is made up of seven different colors red orange yellow green blue indigo violet#L-F
it is made when raindrops fall on something like a leaf and the sunshine shines through the leaf and the raindrop acts like a prism#L-E
the primary colors of light are blue green and red#L-F
and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and sin#L-F
yellow is made when mixing green and red#L-F
magenta is made when mixing red and blue#L-F
and sin is made when mixing green and blue#L-F
when we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow#L-E
when we had the class debate i was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves and now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight that means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves it depends on how you look at it or what your experiment is trying to prove in our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines thomas young experiment#L-EE
the way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color the green light keeps going until it goes into your eye then the brain identifies what color and it is#L-EE
cones tire easily if you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired so when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel#L-EE
this is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order as you know there are seven colors that we know of they all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed but when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed for some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest#L-EE
a thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights this happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun the sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic the earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow the colors that glow are red pink and green#L-EE
they also have something called the law of reflection the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection to clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle#L-EF
but first natural light there are two sections that i am going to write about first photoluminescence photoluminescence is made from a living thing like electric sale they make their own light therefore electric sale are electroluminescent so are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi#L-EF
1 is it true that all we see is light my theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes#L-E
2 how do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque opaque light bounces off it into your eyes#L-E
transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly#L-E
translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects#L-E
1 how do you think light travels my theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going my theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines like a flashlight that also explains why light is hot#L-EE
reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off and blue light hit it it would absorb#L-E
if you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow#L-E
how we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down the solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around#L-E
we did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows first we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows#L-EF
how do out make a rainbow with a prism the white light goes in to the prism and it splits the light up into 7 different color s and those different colors are the colors of them rainbow#L-E
how you make a rainbow with rain rain acts likes prisms and do the same thing that prisms do#L-E
how you see a yellow rose red and green are reflected and all the other colors were absorbed#L-E
water refracting light is when light goes in the water after light is in air the light is bent by the water#L-E
an eclipse course when the earth or the moon blocks the suns light#L-E
a solar eclipse happens when the moon is between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the suns light#L-E
a shadow is when light is shewn on a opaque object and the shadow is what is behind the opaque object#L-E
light travels in all directions i need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else my theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight#L-E
all we see is light#L-E
if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed#L-E
we belove that a rain drop can make a rainbow#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon#L-E
a solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun it occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth the moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon#L-EE
the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection#L-F
red and green make yellow#L-F
a penumbra is a lighter shadow#L-F
the primary colors are red green and blue#L-F
the secondary colors of light are yellow magenta and cyan#L-F
the primary colors of light are red green and blue#L-F
