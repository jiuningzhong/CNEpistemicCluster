L-E,how a shadow is made a light nose on a big object
L-E,rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms
L-E,the order of colors in the rainbow goes red orange yellow green blue indigo violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave
L-E,this is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye
L-E,its the same with magenta except blue red nonces off
L-E,its also the same with cyan except blue green light bounces off
L-E,shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow the shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object
L-E,it depends on the time of day for the size of the shadow
L-E,a convex lens also helps focus the light
L-E,it dost focus the light
L-E,if you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water
L-E,wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose
L-E,wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow the blue is absorbed and you cant see it
L-E,other lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow
L-E,a liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth
L-E,light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves
L-E,light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line it was proved by many people a long time ago
L-E,a shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow
L-E,solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on
L-E,you have three eye cones in your eyes to see different couplers like i said before the easy way to se many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green
L-E,glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work
L-E,a shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object to see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light
L-E,a solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red
L-E,this is how a shadow is made a shadow is made when light hits an object
L-E,this is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow
L-E,how we make a rainbow with rain after it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow
L-E,solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy
L-E,my theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves
L-E,my theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light
L-E,the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits
L-E,my understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest
L-E,anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected
L-E,rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops the raindrops acts as prisms
L-E,other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction
L-E,if you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came
L-E,i learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth
L-E,a shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow
L-E,i also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity
L-E,the northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth
L-E,if you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green
L-E,if you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected
L-E,when you see a rainbow you only see half of it a rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see
L-E,if you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black
L-E,fluorescence objects are glow in the dark objects a sea animal that lives under the water is glow in the dark and glow in the dark star stickers and bandages fluorescence objects are made be friction like two rocks rubbing together
L-E,a lunar eclipse is when the moon covers the sun long time ago a man predicted that there would be a lunar eclipse and he was right
L-E,a solar eclipse is when the sun covers the moon
L-E,my understanding about shadows is that when light hits you it creates a shadow my theory is that the light hits you and goes around you to make a shadow heres a picture to make it more simple
L-E,also they react like chemiluminescence witch is a process of changing chemic energy into light energy
L-E,solar panels absorb sun light rays and turn them into energy
L-E,to reflect colors the object has to be the same color to reflect the light colorto absorb light color the object has to be not the same color to be absorb
L-E,i think that light travels in straight lines and some other people think that light travels in waves i also think that light is a wave but it travels in straight lines i think light travels in straight lines in two ways
L-E,a rainbows are made by raindrops that act like a prism that make the rainbow
L-E,if you look at a green apple for a long time the green cone gets tired but the red and blue are not tired and together red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite color of green
L-E,most things that glow have some fluorescent paint on them this paint absorbs light and then glows until it has no more light absorbed in it
L-E,a shadow is made when darkness made when light shines on a opaque object
L-E,a liner eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon
L-E,a solar eclipse is when the moon is between the sun and the earth
L-E,a shadow is made when a light source hits an object
L-E,a lunar eclipse is when the sun foe between the moon and casts a shadow
L-E,i need to understand why you can get two different kinds of shadows one that is larger than you and one that is smaller than you my theory of what happens is that it appends on the time of day
L-E,what helps things that glow are fluorescence pink and other colors
L-E,if your body wants to see a red rose the red is bounced into your eyes and the other colors are absorbs
L-E,if your body wants to see a yellow green and red is bounced into you eyes and the blue is absorbed
L-E,solar panels takes in light and makes it in to energy
L-E,my understanding shadows starts at the shadow view if a light sours hits a optic nontransparent object which creates a shadow such as a person is standing behind a light sours and a shadow papers behind them
L-E,rain can can be used as prisms thats why theres a rainbow after it rains
L-E,a solar panel absorbs light and uses it as energy
L-E,fireflies produce light from their abdominals because of a chemical reaction caused by lucifer and lucifer this is called photoluminescence
L-E,this is how a glow stick works when you snap a glow stick it makes a little hole and to chemicals collide and then they glow this is called chemiluminescence
L-E,a shadow is made by standing in front of a light source and then the place you block up is where the shadow is made
L-E,a solar eclipse is when the moon passes in between the sun and the earth causing a big shadow
L-E,i thought glow in the dark could only happen with one thine but then i read yasmin note and saw that it happens with three things heat friction and electricity
L-E,in the shadows view i learned the closer the sun is to you the stronger it is
L-E,also i learned that your body blocked the sun and that creates a shadow the sun goes through the ground and makes a shadow for a root
L-E,a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside
L-E,we see a red rose because the primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off
L-E,we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off
L-E,a shadow is the darkness left behind when a light sours shines on a nontransparent object
L-E,a solar eclipse is when the moon blocks the sun light from coming to the earth
L-E,a lunar clips is when the sun blocks the moons light from going to earth
L-E,you can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain rain is what make the rainbow in the sky
L-E,solar panels are panels that use light to make electricity
L-E,all we see is light without light we can not see
L-E,to make a rainbow you need raindrops on plants then the sun shines on the plants then makes a rainbow
L-E,you can make a rainbow by holding up a prism to the sun the white light will go through the prism and make a rainbow
L-E,the northern lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky they occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity to small for us to see
L-E,solar panels take in the suns rays a make energy with them
L-E,lasers are the best wielding equipment that i no of because it saved the navy millions laser is short for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation
L-E,i think that light travels in a straight line because we did a lot of experiments and proved that it travels that way
L-E,light travels in a wave
L-E,the rainbow makes white light
L-E,when white light goes through a practicum it makes a rainbow
L-E,when white light goes through a rain drop it make a rainbow
L-E,when you see a red rose the red light bonus into our
L-E,when you see a yellow flower the yellow light bonus into our
L-E,when you see colored light or a rose so if you a red rose red light bonus into your eyes but blue green get absorb into the flower
L-E,my theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line
L-E,it is made when raindrops fall on something like a leaf and the sunshine shines through the leaf and the raindrop acts like a prism
L-E,when we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow
L-E,1 is it true that all we see is light my theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes
L-E,2 how do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque opaque light bounces off it into your eyes
L-E,transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly
L-E,translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects
L-E,reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off and blue light hit it it would absorb
L-E,if you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow
L-E,how we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down the solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around
L-E,how do out make a rainbow with a prism the white light goes in to the prism and it splits the light up into 7 different color s and those different colors are the colors of them rainbow
L-E,how you make a rainbow with rain rain acts likes prisms and do the same thing that prisms do
L-E,how you see a yellow rose red and green are reflected and all the other colors were absorbed
L-E,water refracting light is when light goes in the water after light is in air the light is bent by the water
L-E,an eclipse course when the earth or the moon blocks the suns light
L-E,a solar eclipse happens when the moon is between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the suns light
L-E,a shadow is when light is shewn on a opaque object and the shadow is what is behind the opaque object
L-E,light travels in all directions i need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else my theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight
L-E,all we see is light
L-E,if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed
L-E,we belove that a rain drop can make a rainbow
L-E,a solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon
