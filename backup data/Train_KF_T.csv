L-EF,I do not think so because Ive touch a tree that has fungus on it it did not come on to me
L-EF,fungus etch dead thing not grow on them
L-EF,fungi and fungus is piratically the same thing   because fungi etch what eve its on sow does fungus but mi us geeing
L-EF,I think so to I ha seen mold on blue sees
L-EF,is that fungus mushrooms give trees minerals and the tree gives the fungi mushrooms sugar
L-F, I think that it takes a week or more for fungi to spread I think that fungi spreads to eat and to get energy
L-F, I think that fungus is basically mold because they look the same  there both the same ripe
L-F,I think fungus is a related to mold  like there in the same family there in a family
L-F, I disagree fungi is related to mold they look the same and there in the same family
L-F,how does fungi help the planet I think it helps the trees grow
L-EF,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part
L-EF,Your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but I have had light near and it was dark because I was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think I have Benn there long enough but with no light I don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room
L-EF,Lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut Simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth
L-EF,Transparent means full SE through so nontransparent means opaque non SEe through
L-EF,Aura Borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to France or Italy The natives feared them because they thought they were evil things
L-EF,Photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light FACT over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence
L-EF,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head
L-EF,those are the colors of your eye cones What I mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the Secondary colors
L-EF,The Secondary colors of light are made by mixing the Primary colors of light here are the Secondary colors of light  Yellow Magenta and Cyan here is how their made
L-EF,the Northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter
L-EF,A transparent object is something you can see though like Stephanie light can go right though it
L-EF,A translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light
L-EF,When you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows And the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear
L-EF,If you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet and Indigo
L-EF,My understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light
L-EF,Lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth Laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day
L-EF,The law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray
L-EF,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle
L-EF,Convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated
L-EF,I also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent
L-EF,Another one of the things I learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time They could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow
L-EF,When light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point 
L-EF,Lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world It can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything 
L-EF,When white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow All the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-EF,Chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light I used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence 
L-EF,Making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out An example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining 
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection When an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle 
L-EF,A translucent object is not see through That means that you cant look through it But a little light can come through A translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer 
L-EF,A concave mirror has a sort of cave shape We have mirrors that are flat the mirror that I am talking about is that mirror but pushed in This mirror looks like a bowl When you look into it you see a long shape of yourself 
L-EF,a convex mirror is the very opposite This mirror is pushed out This mirror looks like a belly As we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down 
L-EF,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided The light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head 
L-EF,lasers are very bright and very strong They can go through anything If you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop 
L-EF,a shadow wilel appear when you are facing north Your shadow wilel be in front of you If you are facing south your shadow wilel be behind you And if you are facing east your shadow wile be on your right and if you are facing west your shadow is on your left 
L-EF,To make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light Shine all of the colors in the same spot Then you will see white light Here is a picture to make it more simple 
L-EF,Light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens  whits is called diffused reflection 
L-EF,To make a rainbow withs prism is simple  Just get a prism and go outside Then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow But sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-EF,Co lours of light You can make white light by mixing red green and blue  primary colors of light light together 
L-EF,The secondary colors of paint are orange  green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other 
L-EF,There are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes They are red green and blue They are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta 
L-EF,The gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point That point is the meeting place of the light 
L-EF,Your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness In a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright But at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between 
L-EF,The angle incidents equals the angle of reflection 
L-EF,A defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror 
L-EF,When two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball One shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object 
L-EF,There are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only There is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was Christian Huygens The other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines And there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves 
L-EF,You have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue They are all sensitive to there own colors 
L-EF,The next view is the Co lours of Light view with rainbows A rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow You can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-EF,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally 
L-EF,You have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone The red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light 
L-EF,We have 3 different eye cones The 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue 
L-EF,A concave mirror looks like a bowl When light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below 
L-EF,There is some thing called the law of reflection The law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror 
L-EF,A diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror Its when all the light goes in lots of directions 
L-EF,Objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects Light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous The sun is luminous as well 
L-EF,Thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks One of these sources is wintergreen Life Savers If you are chewing one turn the lights of  Look in a mirror while chewing Look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks 
L-EF,Cones are things that respond to colored light There are three kinds of light that cones respond to Red blue and green 
L-EF,Light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light A prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet 
L-EF,There are different names for the colors of light Those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light There not just named orally The primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors 
L-EF,The primary colors are red blue and green The same colors as your eye cones 
L-EF,A convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave 
L-EF,A concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite 
L-EF,A convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you A concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up Concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close 
L-EF,They also have something called the law of reflection The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection To clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle 
L-EF,You can add another lens to one of those lenses also A double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light 
L-EF,There are two kinds of light Natural and artificial Natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs 
L-EF,But first natural light There are two sections that I am going to write about First photoluminescence Photoluminescence is made from a living thing Like electric sale They make their own light Therefore electric sale are electroluminescent So are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi 
L-EF,The second thing is fluorescence That is made with friction Like when two stones rub together They make fire whits is heat and light That is fluorescence 
L-EF,News flash If you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed 
L-EF,And umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source That makes a big shadow that is pretty darker 
L-EF,A penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source That makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter 
L-EF,Eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down The image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize 
L-EF,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it All the colors will come out the other side
L-EF,An umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra 
L-EF,We did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows First we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows 
L-EF,Shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are 
L-EF,The rainbow is made up of colored light The colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet 
L-EF,There are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue 
L-EF,A concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and 
L-EF,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large 
L-EF,When colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light 
L-EF,Sundials are a form of telling time You can tell the time by the position of the shadow 
L-EF,Shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in 
L-EF,A concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused 
L-EF,A convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking 
L-F,All of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light 
L-F,A transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through 
L-F,A translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through 
L-F,An opaque object lets 0 through 
L-F,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection

L-F,Red and blue make magenta 
L-F,Blue and green make cyan and 
L-F,green and red make yellow 
L-F,All three primary colors make white 
L-F,Light and materials The most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors But first mirrors There are two kinds of mirrors There names are concave and convex 
L-F,You cant forget flat mirrors There sort of in the middle Flat mirrors are pretty important to 
L-F,That law only works for smooth mirrors though 
L-F,On bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions That is a called a diffused reflection 
L-F,Now lenses There are two kinds of lenses Concave and convex Just like the mirrors they do the same things 
L-F,Lenses are transparent 
L-F,There are two other forms that Translucent and opaque 
L-F,A transparent object means see through 
L-F,a translucent object colors the light and 
L-F,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely 
L-F,Now  artificial light First chemiluminescence Chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light 
L-F,Then there are lasers Lasers are extremely bright and very strong They can go through anything 
L-F,There are two different ways you can play with shadows One is an umbra and the other is a penumbra 
L-F,Those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things Those things are eclipses There are two eclipses that we know of Solar and lunar 
L-F,3 Is it true that we cant see without light Of course not 
L-F,The colors of light I think are in the rainbow winch are redOrangeYellowGreenBlueIndigoand Violet 
L-F,The primary colors of light are red green and blue 
L-F,the primary colors of pigment paint are Bluebeard yellow 
L-F,There are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial The kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers 
L-F,Photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves 
L-F,The aurora Borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive 
L-F,fl you want to make white light you mix red blue and green together and you have white light 
L-F,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is in front of the moon 
L-F,a solar eclipse is when the moon goes in front of the earth 
L-F,A concave mirror is a mirror that is bent in 
L-F,A convex mirror is a mirror that is bent out 
L-F,Photoluminescence is made by animals whose habits don't have much light 
L-F,Misalliance is made by semicircles 
L-F,Transparent objects are objects that you see threw 
L-F,translucent is when only some light can shine threw 
L-F,concave mirrors reflect light out and convex mirrors footrace the light 
L-F,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the light goes onto the mirror and bounces in the isopleth direction 
L-F,the law of diffuse refection is the light goes to the mirror and bounces in the same detection 
L-F,concave lenses and light rays help near sited people see far sited and 
L-F,convex mirrors help far sited people see near sited 
L-F,solar powered things are made with solar panels 
L-F,lasers are a toolbox they melt mettle 
L-F,An penumbra is a shadow shining around the shadow 
L-F,An umbra is a dark shadow that comes from a small light 
L-F,An opaque is an nontransparent thing 
L-F,Chemiluminescence is produced by a chemical reaction 
L-F,Luminescence is made by living things 
L-F,Lasers are very bright and intense and can burn through anything 
L-F,Things that glow have florescences 
L-F,Co lours of light The primary colors of light are red blue and green 
L-F,And the secondary colors of light are yellow magenta and cyan 
L-F,Black light is made up of all the colors 
L-F,and white light reflects everything 
L-F,If you look at something that is blue all the colors are absorbed except blue and that is for every other color 
L-F,Light and materials A transparent object is a see through 
L-F,a translucent object is see through but a little burier 
L-F,An opaque object is not see through 
L-F,The law of reflection is if light hit s a mirror on a 90 degree angle and it goes back ons 90 degree angle 
L-F,Diffuse reflection is if you crumple tin foil the light goes all over the place 
L-F,A convex lens concentrates the light 
L-F,a concave lens spreads the light out
L-F,The secondary colors of light are Yellow magenta and cyan 
L-F,White light is made from the primary colors mixed 
L-F,If you shine light on a prism it makes a rainbow
L-F,Eye cones are cones in your eyes that help you see colors 
L-F,Northern lights are colored lights 
L-F,Transparent objects are objects that can not be seen through and are opaque 
L-F,Translucent objects are objects are you can see through but not perfectly 
L-F,An opaque object is a object that is sold and cannot be seen through 
L-F,The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection

L-F,Chemiluminescence is chemical made light 
L-F,fluorescence is things that glow like a glow sticks from a party 
L-F,Lasers are a really strong form of light 
L-EF,"Ants can carry dirt on their back like when they carry food. ant hills has lots of rooms, like one of the room is where the queen lives and lays eggs. If There is no queen ant, but there is a ""King Ant"" Which is not a tig maybe the ""King Ant"" Leads their ant colonie to another ant colonie where that ant colonie has a queen"
L-EF,"The information I have learned is all from brainpop.
[ - There are over 12,000 species of ants, many species have different behaviors. I have also learned the ""exoskeleton"" around the ant protects the ant, but it also helps the ant move about. My final thing I learned was that male ants are called ""drones"" and their only job is to mate with the queen to create eggs, afterwords, they die.- ]"
L-EF,some trees change color and die during the cold weather in the fall and in winter. But some of them like the tall GREEN tree and pine trees. Now you know why pine trees are christmas trees. Also It would be a little weird if you hang ornaments on deciduous trees. deciduous trees are those trees that chane color in the winter and die.
L-EF,Salva has a journey to his home town to eathiopia. At the beggening of the journey he had to walk and than get the honey and than walk some more and than get his uncle to join his journey and than let his uncle to hunt down food and than eat the food and than walk some more and than help fix the boat and than test the boat and than eat some food and than get mosquito bites and than travel on the river.
L-EF,for this experiment at school that I did at class was that we tried to move water from the ground to the table and we kind of had some mistakes the litle plugs kept coming of and we did not get much water in the first test but on second we improved so it shows me that when you first do somting it does not go well but if your trying again you will succeed
L-EF,"Our Test diagram was the 3 way vowel on top and the pipe in the water the first test we got 41 ML and the difficulties we had were keeping the pipe in the water and the 3 way vowel we had trouble working it so we wasted some time. What we modified we taped the pipe to the cup so it can stay and taped the cup to the table just in case, the water we moved was 101 ML our difficulties were turning the thing on the 3 way vowel fast, our controls pulling and turning the thing on the 3 way vowel and the thing that was hard and not fair was you can not touch the other things. In Enrichment some people went outside to get water they got a bit of water the people inside got more and we had to put it on our heads."
L-EF,"When we did our latest project, It was about filtering water. unfortunetly, our water was gray. I think it was becuase of too much air carbon. we used it in two of our steps instead of one. next time, we need less carbon, and also switch the steps around. 
filtering water is important because nya's sister got sick from drinking dirty water. my theory is that she got sick because there are actually nitrates in dirty water an nitrates aren't good for the human body. 
New information that I want to learn is ""What chemicals are in nitrate and how are they bad for us to drink? and how are they made exactly?"""
L-EF,"In the last chapter ofA Long Walk To Water, Salva visits schools to talk about the project and to raise money. but then it skips two years ahead to 2009. nya looks at a man holding up a poster. uncle read it out and now they have clean water! as soon as I found out my prediction was that the man was salva and he was doing his project there. and I was right! but I also found out years ago salva's tribe was in war with nya's. I know this becuase nya said that salva had different markings/scars on his face. also, when nya got the clean water, she was looking at the clarity of how it was so clear. this made me compare it to when we were filtering the water and how it was a little bit more clear after. I was also suprised when it was all based on a true story except for some parts. this made me compare to when we had a budget of 100$ and we needed to buy the materials without spending too much and we had to pump it and filter it and it was very hard but I think it was harder for salva becuase he needed the right materials and they were more expensive."
L-EF,[ - in each ant family( ant hill) there is one queen ant. the queen ant gives birth to babies. When the baby ants are born they are usally white. as they grow up they turn black.- ] thousands and thousands ofants live in one ant hill like an apartment. ants eat sweet fruits and other sweet things. there are many different kinds of ants. Ants live everywhere!!!
L-EF,"[-Grasshoppers go through 4 stages of their life cycle egg,Nymph,adult Grasshoppers, and death. A nymph looks like a little adut Grasshopper.But with out wings - ]"
L-EF,"I think you miss understood. This is the mosse's spores perpuse :) :Mosses reproduce using spores, not seeds, and have no flowers. Moss gametophytes have stems which may be simple orbranchedand upright or prostrate. Their leaves are simple, usually only a single layer of cells with no internal air spaces, often with thicker midribs."
L-EF,"groups of ants are called colonies
some ants are so small a person can barely see them
some ants eat small animals, some insects, and some plants and more foods
ants are soocial insects"
L-EF,"[ -After what bill said: plants are producers and animals that eat plants are herbivores. when herbivores eat the plant, that plant that has stored energy that goes into an animal willthen the animal have energy as well. an animal that eats a herbivore is called a carnivore. the energy will go into the carnivore. when animals die there is something called decomposers which take the energy from the animal and put it in the soil for new plants to grow there. this is called a food web. - ] Quote from Bill Nye the science guy: food is fuel and energy. - varsha's add on information!"
L-EF,"[ - Segmentation can help the earthwormmove. Each segment or section has muscles and bristles called setae. The bristles or setae help anchor and control the wormwhenmoving through soil.The bristles hold a section of the wormfirmly into the ground while the other part of the body protrudes forward.
Here's a picture of what i'm trying to explain.

L-EF,"[ - is that rain comes into the mushroom, which makes the steam or smoke (what)- ]
[ - That mushrooms have no holes. - ]
[ - How it comes to there spores? Is it Moss?- ]
[ - about this, (from BrainPop), is that when spores (or something) does a thing called Budding, that makes it come off the mushroom (not really) this makes it (in my thinking) let the smoke come out when you flick it.- ]
[ - More info I have is that the mushroom is called the Puffball Mushroom.- ]
[ - (as of 12/6/18) They dont spur out steam or smoke.- ]
[ - (As of 12/10) The Puffball ISN'T A MUSHROOM. It actually is a fungi, but isn't a mushroom. (What?)- ]
[ - More, the smoke or steam is actualy DUST LIKE SPORES! So that means, that the smoke is actually SPORES, That look like DUST!- ]
I guess I found the answer to my theory! or did I?
[ - I see that they get the spores out from getting Impacted (like the flick I saw at the Albany PineBush)- ]
I guess that's it
Here is a picture!

A Puffball (mushroom)"
L-EF,"[ - fungi like mushrooms,midew,and
toadtools are not plants .They dont have chorophyllso they cant make their own food. fungi release enzymes that decompose dead plants and animals .- ]"
L-EF,"Hello I am Timmy and I learned about coyotes position in the food web. coyotes are the top predators in the pine bush ecosystem and will eat deer, rabbits, rodents, chipmunks, carrion and much more. coyotes will also eat berries and fruit if they need to, but they mostly eat meat."
L-EF,"Parts of a plant
The blade is broad and flat. A stalk attaches the blade to the stem. A simple leaf has one bade and a compond leaf has several blades on the same petiole.
Veins in the leave carry food and water from the leaves to the rest of the plant. They also make a strong support that give the leaves its shape. The veins of a broad leaf form a netlike pattern. The veins of narrow leaves are parallel. ( leaves size are also adapted by habitat and maximize photosynthesis.)"
L-EF,"Plantshave only three tissue types: Dermal, Ground and ,Vascular. Dermal tissue covers the outer surface of herbaceousplants. Vascular tissue includes xylem, phloem, parenchyma, and cambium cells. Two views of thestructureof the root and root meristem
by Elena Delrio"
L-EF,"The following are examples of structures and organelles that can be found in typical plantcells:
Cell (plasma) Membrane: This thin, semi-permeable membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell, enclosing its contents.
Cell Wall: This rigid outer covering of the cell protects the plant cell and gives it shape.
Chloroplast: Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthsisin a plant cell. They contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs energy from sunlight.
Cytoplasm: The gel-like substance within the cell membrane is known as cytoplasm. It contains water, enzymes, salts, organelles, and various organic molecules.
Cytoskeleton: This network of fibers throughout the cytoplasm helps the cell maintain its shape and gives support to the cell."
L-EF,"Leaves have unique structures, called veins, that transport liquids and nutrients to leaf cells. Veins also carry the products of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree.
A tree leaf has several types of veins. The central one is called the midrib or midvein. Other veins connect to the midrib and have their own unique patterns.
Tree leaf veins in dicots (we also call these trees hardwoods or deciduous trees) are all considered to be net-veined or reticulate-veined.This means that the veins branch from the main rib and then sub-branch into finer veins.
There are two classifications you need to"
L-EF,"Peroxisomes: Peroxisomes are tiny, single membrane bound structures that contain enzymes which produce hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. These structures are involved in plant processes such as photorespiration.
Plasmodesmata:These pores or channels are found between plant cell walls and allow molecules and communication signals to pass between individual plant cells.
Ribosomes: Consisting of RNAand proteins, ribosomes are responsible for protein assembly. They can be found either attached to the rough ER or free in the cytoplasm.
Vacuole: This plant cell organelle provides support for and participates in a variety of cellular functions including storage, detoxification, protection, and growth. When a plant cell matures, it typically contains one large liquid-filled vacuole."
L-EF,"Fruits, vegetables, and flowers come from plants. Plants include ferns and mosses, but not mushrooms. They live in soil, water, or even the air. Leaves have something inside that can turn sunlight into food. Flowers and pollen are needed for plants to make fruit and seeds. The sweet smell of flowers attracts bees and butterflies to spread pollen to other flowers. The bugs drink the nectar and the pollen sticks to them. Find out how plants help us survive."
L-EF,"Plants need carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is how the plant makes oxygen and food."
L-EF,I have learned that moss detaches from the thing it's on when it's going to start to die. I know from my experiment of takeing detached moss and putting it into good soil. After a few of days it was no longer detachable.
L-F,squirels are fat
L-F,[ - mosquitos are the most deady creatures in the world. they can cary thousands of deiseases.- ]
L-F,dont let ants out and with a parant you can do experiments
L-F,i have to say that penguins can't fly ecause there only home is the artic! and they have to stay there! also because they where built for the artic to!
L-F,I think berry trees have red stuff on it.
L-F,[ - is that worms in the courtyard only come out when you lift some thing wet or when it rains then when the rain comes the worms come up from out of the dirt and i know i hav seen it .- ]
L-F,the moss will eventually all die at least therse a 50%50 chance that it will
L-F,there are a billon ants in a ant hill
L-F,[ - Moss can only grow in a clean enviroment.Moss can't grow if there is pollution.- ]
L-F,I don't think plants have energy I think they have nurtrients that turns in to fuel/energy for the thing thats eats them.
L-F,today we did a water challenge. the challenge was that you had to move 100mL of water 100 centimeters to another beaker. the challenge was a bit hard at first but when we got a hang of it.
L-F,"Our plan worked! Here are our stuff we had, 4 tubes 1 ,3 -way valve , 6 connectors , 2 beakers (always), and a sringe , and a measuring tape."
L-F,"[ - When we worked in teams of 4/3, We made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange- ]"
L-F,"During this experiment, I learned it's kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because you have to come up with a plan etc."
L-F,"well i guess it could be hard if you did not have a plan but other wise, It would not be that hard."
L-F,starit was esey up thehoill
L-F,[ - is- ] that we used the brown filter first than we used A carben then white filter and 150 0
L-F,Our Nitrate level was 50. Our groups plan is in my section but failure is a road to sucsecion
L-F,"1. Sugar
2. Carbonation
3. Water"
L-F,i think that they have what they need they have food water and sun
L-F,maybe a cherry tree or some type of trees full of fruits.
L-F,there may be food in the tree
L-F,[ - is the apple fell of the tree and the decomposers eat the apple and the apple got less energy and rotted.- ]
L-F,I think the worms use the slime on their bodies help them to move around in the soil.
L-F,"Maybe we can install underground pipes, that go to all of the villages, and then the water can go through a filter, and be cleaned and ready to drink."
L-F,So my theroy is that we could we can put water towers in different areas then we put pipes in
L-F,"My theory is that if you drank only sugar drinks for 2 weeks, these could be some of the results:
*You might get diabetes
*Your teethmight rot and fall out
*You might have a hyperactivity seizure
*Your organs might get weaker because they had too much sugar energy and shorted out.
*You would gain a lot of weight
*You might get dehydrated if there is caffeine in your drinks.
*Your blood sugars can spike and drop, making you hyper and tired."
L-F,"I dont think we can make water.
We get our water from the rain or ground water and other types of ways, these are like the types of ways we get water"
L-F,[we can use ships to get it to poor courtys or bulid pips ouder nith the ocan to carry the water
L-F,You can create water but it would be dangrass and we might loose osgyan.
L-F,resour
L-F,"In science we planted beans on 11/31 now it is 12/3 and there was no progress then i looked up how long will it take so
[ - is that on 12/7 or 12/10 it will show some progress- ]"
L-F,I agree with Serena because the plants made no progress over the weekend. So I will also check with Serena if the plants made any progress on the 7th of December and\or 10th of December.
L-F,Flora and I am doing a experiment with moss. We put moss that was half way dead in a cup filled with dirt inside the cup there is a plant which was detached from the ground with it's roots and we water it every 3 of 4 days.
L-F,Today is the 10th of dec there is a little progress the beans are swealing like crazy i'm going to continue my work and keep checking and write more on those days
L-F,Sqwirls and chipmunks live in trees

L-F,[ - When an ant builds a ant hill they make tunnelsin they ants hill like rooms- ]
L-F,"[ - Ants do not find the hills they build them with dirt!- ]
But I am not sure how they build them. I am pretty sure they work together to build it I will have to find that out!"
L-F,yes exactly thank you its also made from sand and pine nedles
L-F,[ - Ants do not just find th hills- ]
L-F,i think a few years at most
L-F,you should make your question longer because bees live 122 to 152 days or early bumblebees can live 28 days
L-F,so far what i know is that rain after it gets dehydrated it creates mud and later after thats done it creates soil
L-F,moss forms by the little seeds that are let go by the moss
L-F,[ - is that moss lets go clusters of seeds into the air and let the wind carry it away- ]
L-F,it probably grew like that over time.Maybe something happened to it.
L-F,"moss grows in cool and wet conditions, and the moss groes back every spring after winter."
L-F,"[ - is that weather is a super strong force that uses lots of different matter like wind, water,houses and more.- ] weather can c HH znge a lot of things. LIke people if it always snowed no crops could grow and all living things would die out."
L-F,Spores carried by wind. They also need a little moisture.
L-F,"[ - Ants sleep in the winter, they dig their colonies deeper below the frost line and can be frozen without harm.- ]"
L-F,Spores carried by wind spread the moss.
L-F,moss dosent just grow on trees it wiil grow on most things if it has moisture it will grow
L-F,They need moisture and shade to grow.
L-F,Small animals and insects live in moss.
L-F,Ants make there ant hills out oit of dirtand make a hole
L-F,"ants are super strong, so they dig the hole quiqly even after it gets destroyed"
L-F,there may be thousands of ant holes
L-F,there are alot more then a thousand ant holes on earth more like BILLIONS of ant hills.
L-F,ants has recepters whitch could detect food or danger
L-F,"[ - I think worker ants do most of the work, the worker ants would be building the ant hill. I agree that the ant hills would be made out of dirt too.- ]"
L-F,The Need The Sun For Giving Them Nutriens
L-F,[ - is that they eat anamals that cant hert them that much- ]
L-F,"[ - Is, that the white and black catipiller is piosonous.- ]

L-F,[ - is they might crall over the school like going on it and crall on to the roof to go in the courtYARD - ]
L-F,[ - is that if a predetor is close it will turn over to blend in- ]
L-F,[ - is it flips over- ]
L-F,looked like the start of a bee hive
L-F,"The trees get nutrious y the water feeding the roots, and the sun!"
L-F,"There can be a lot of different animals.
[ - insects are anials too.- ] If insect are animals there is so many types of animals like grass hoppers,ants mousqutioand other different insects ."
L-F,They have sounds that they make!
L-F,A mousqutio is a arachnid so is a scopein and a spider.
L-F,"The animals and insects that live in the courtyard are mainly birds, bees, grasshoppers, ants and antholes, and possibly some arachnids."
L-F,the answer is the sun pushes the air on our body and they call it wind
L-F,"yes
[ - is- ] yes during oter sesings in winter ther fur might white or oter colers"
L-F," the evidence of how moss is fuzzy
"
L-F,well jack you see air you see it everywhere. and air s everthing. and plus air is the first thing that you see in the morning when you wake up!

L-F,"know I know why mosquito bites itch so much.
mosquitos are so annoying.
the itchyness can last for so long when the real bit part is only a few seconds!!
mosquitos."
L-F,the mosquito is just trying to get food

L-F,Ant hills are nonliving
L-F,Bees polinate flowers for other animals and us.
L-F,[ - is many apples rot because the weather is changing - ]
L-F,"Spores are carried by the wind. Then, it grows into moss."
L-F,I think you miss understand what spores are. Spores are kind of like the seeds for moss exept there're microscphic.
L-F,Ad a midrib is..: Alarge strengthened vein along the midline of a leaf.
L-F,Moss spores spread onto certain things and they need sun and water to help them grow
L-F,Are all beehives edible
L-F,"I learned that there are over 22,000 different types of moss, but we mostly see here in ny fire moss and Ceratodon purpureus moss."
L-F,"[some trees are very slow and takes 20 to30 years, some reach to full size 10-15 years.it's growth depends on what type of tree it is."
L-F,I think spiders climb walls by gripping into cracks with their legs.
L-F,theere is millions of ants thats how
L-F,ant hills are made of dirt clay and some times pine nedles!!!
L-F,Ant hills can also be built out of sand.
L-F,[ - is that the enviormet is good here at this time .- ]
L-F,I dont think metal ever lived.

L-F,"[ - There are over 12,000 kinds of ants. Males have wings. Females don't have wings and when the queen dies the colony falls apart.- ]"
L-F,Rhizoids are the super thin roots that hold the moss in place. They aren't very strong so you could pick it up without struggle.
L-F,Rhizoids attach the moss on whatever it's growing on.
L-F,[ - poison is used to scare predetors away or else the predotor will dye slowly- ]
L-F,[ - every living thing has energy- ]
L-F,When I watched a brain pop video I learned that seedless plants have spores. Spores are kind of like the seeds for seedless plant exept they're microscphic.
L-F,"[ - Moss grows and spreads called ""spores."" They're special reproductive cells that grow on moss. Since the spores are VERY light, the wind blows th spores away, creating more moss.- ]"
L-F,Moss can grow anywhere even on trees and rocks.
L-F,ants will also eat threr ownkind whe the die
L-F,Ants eat worms.
L-F,i found a video of a tree that grows 40 diffrent stone fruits the the way the man who made the tree was he got a branch from each fruit tree and put them together with plastic wrap and it took 3 years for the tree to grow and it growd all by itself
L-F,The raise of the sun are so powerful that even some of Jupiter.The raise feeds all of the producers and animals.
L-F,ants used ant hills for bad weather they alos used it for store food in ant hills.
L-F,i now have found ut that they also use co2 to make there sugar to.
L-F,i just found out they give off oxegen into the air which is what we breath in .
L-F,Some ants build there ant hills by weaving leaves togther
L-F,"A swarm of army ants can kill 100,000 insects,spiders and even small animals in a day"

L-F,Ants have been around Sens the Cretaceous period!
L-F,"Brydie, wolves do not live in the pine bush, they live in canada and the western Us"
L-F,you also need co2 for photosynthesis
L-F,I learned that there are different types of air poulltion can effect different people. Like in the video I saw ittold me that there are air types that are hazordus and can be very harmful.
L-F,Bryophyte is a moss
L-F,[ - mosses and ferns are eukaryotic which means they have nucleus.they also contain cell walls made of cellouse a fibrous and tough material- ]

L-F,evaporation is water. water is steaming.
L-F,yeah africa is closer to equator
L-F,hey tyler a shorter word for water is H2O
L-F,yes thatsn right but some of the gose to the trees and dose not dry up and it stays under ground
L-F,"i know that one diffrense is that sugar drinks have stuff like
cornsyrup
natral flavors
lots of sugar
lots of lactose."
L-F,"[ - The Water comes from graciers, lakes, groundwaters, swamps, and river.- ]"
L-F,Water scarcity happens when a place is too hot like Africa. The water evaporates more often.
L-F,"Some ways humans purify water are
*Boiling
*Iodine
*Filtration systems
*Evapration traps"
L-F,"One way humans purify water is a filtration system, Another way humans could purify water is boiling the water."
L-F,[ - is that it has to do with chemestrey- ]
L-F,wow you can't we can clean it but making it is a [No] you can serch that ongoogle. But still.
L-F,"We know how to make water but its really hard and there are lots of complications.
( google it )"
L-F,hey timy they already made a filter that can trancfer the salt out of salt water
L-F,Salva doesn't have the mateirials.
L-F,[ - is that we should build filters in big factories and transport water all around the world and check if the filters take out the salt in the water.- ]
L-F,"freshwater is water that humans need to survive,"
L-F,Water pollution is the contamination of bodies of water usually caused by humans. Water pollution happens when contaminants get into the water source.
L-F,because we cant servive without water!!!
L-F,I think in our group we should have put the tube inside the beaker and put tape around it more.
L-F,Fish have gills which help them breathe underwater.
L-F,"The water sikell is so in porentent for us as humens.
and us with plastic is so bad for evey thing . straer
Recycling. or we are going toRegretted.
most of our water comes from our oceans. which are very dirty. There is stillnot much left for the animals and it will be very disgusting cuz I was little pieces of plastic."
L-F,my group put the coffee filters inside the cups and we put the carbin in it and poored the water in. It was clean but it was blue. Next time i would only put a little bit of the carbin and a little bit of the water.
L-F,the bule sand like stuff is the fertilizer
L-F,"Our groups plan was
1. White filter
2. White filter with Activated Carbon
3. Brown Filter
4.White fiter
Unfourtunaly Our plan took out most of our Nitrates wre taken out but our Nitrate level was about 50 Nitrates so in that case our water was still unsafe to drink"
L-F,our groups desigened work we use white fiter then carbon and brown fiter. next time we wont pour too much dirt water in the carbon so it wont go on the table.
L-F,in class we had to filter water with a coffee filter and we learned that if you double the coffee filter over it will do better against the dirty water.
L-F,"To reflect on todays science expirement, I know that I should use carbon as the second step instead of the first."
L-F,so I think that our 3 part filter was good but we messed up on the actived carbon because we did not put in a filter so the water would just stay there
L-F,"When we made the filter we used the W.filter , A. carbon and then B. filter when we filterd the water it turned out clear."
L-F,"When I did the thing which you have to try to turn the dirty water into clean, it was kinda hard because my group sometimes fight, but we did it, but we thought we could use more of the active carbon but that made the water cloudy and dirty, it clean before we use all the active carbon."
L-F,[ - Soda can also weaken you teeth and bones. Water is good for you + water can hydrate you.- ]
L-F,YesterdayI puriefed water. First you do the white filter and then you do the A. carbon and after that you do the brown filter. That's how you get a really good score.
L-F,"During the filtering expriement we did, I learned that if we add to much A carbon, it turns the water all black and cloudy, in conclusiondon't put a lot of A carbon in the water to filter it. :)"
L-F,"When we first filtered our water it still had some bule in it from when it was dirty,but when I was cleaning up I realised that it looked cealer/it had no more color,My theory is that Filters work better over time."
L-F,today we tested how much toxin was in dirty water and there was so much of it! i will continue
L-F,"[ - I learned was that with my group we saw way to filter wateruseing coffe filters! it was so fun because when where doing the project and I saw that we were all having fun in the processe. we also saw that we learned from our mistakes! we had clear water but we though that it coud be MORE clean so we added more carbon and the clear water with the left over dirty water, but it didn't turn out as planed. so thats all I have to tell you about my team project, I hope I tought you all something.- ]"
L-F,Good for salva he did what he wanted. He did what was wright for his people.
L-F,"My class and I finsh the bookA Long walk to water an it was really good.
We should really build pipes around places where people cant get water"
L-F,Even if we get ground water we still have to filter it.
L-F,Mosquioes are the most different creature on the planet because its one of the only living creature carry diseases
L-F,i told you you have to do a 2 finger click when you do that you have to click the open link to new tab.
L-F,DID YOU KNOW THAT ANTS HAVE BEEN ON EARTH SENS DINASORS AND SURVIVED THE ICE AGE
L-F,[ - is that they NEED food to survive!!- ]
L-F," soil is a wonder and i've never heard of white soil. and anyway soil is used for many things like plants,chipmuncks and people."
L-F,"[ - is that most water are dirty in villages, and If we install filters in villages so they can be clean.- ]"
L-F,[ - is that if we find a way to filter saltwater it could help humans- ]
L-EF,"New intrimationThat me and Dylan discoverd is that ant colines could have millions of ants.

[    I need to understand  - How it comes to there spores? Is it Moss?- ]    
[    New Information  - about this, (from BrainPop), is that when spores (or something) does a thing called Budding, that makes it come off the mushroom (not really) this makes it (in my thinking) let the smoke come out when you flick it.- ]    
[    New Information  - More info I have is that the mushroom is called the Puffball Mushroom.- ]

L-EF,"Bigger animals in the food chain kill smaller animals but smaller animals can kill bigger animals. Say if there in a pack then they could take down a bigger animal. 
I think fish don't need air to breath because they have some kind of organe in there body that lets them breath in water and have no need for air
Scientific methods are ways of making there Questions better then they were before 
science should real step up its game by doing other things. 
The courtyard interactions the courtyard interactions and I have been focusing on is the apple tree changing during each season . is the tree dead? Will it have its leaves again?
The courtyard has a lot of dying stuff including trees animals and grass and plants.
Scientists are working on a solution so plants don't die in the winter. I hope it happens.

L-EF,"The information I have learned is all from brainpop.
[    New Information  - There are over 12,000 species of ants, many species have different behaviors. I have also learned the ""exoskeleton"" around the ant protects the ant, but it also helps the ant move about. My final thing I learned was that male ants are called ""drones"" and their only job is to mate with the queen to create eggs, afterwords, they die.- ]"
L-EF,"Why Do Trees Need Sunlight And Water
Trees/Plants Needs Sunlight And Water because-**Plants need waterandsunto make their own food energy (photosynthesis). The Food That They Make Is Sugar! They Make It On LeavesPlants Also Needs Soil! Another Fact:* Air can transport pollen and seeds fromplantsso that newplantscan grow

L-F,"? soil is a wonder and i've never heard of white soil. and anyway soil is used for many things like plants,chipmuncks and people."
L-EF,"Comets, trans-Neptunian objects, or water-rich meteoroids callled protoplanetsfrom the outer reaches of the asteroid belt colliding with Earthmay have brought water to the world's oceans."
L-EF,"Where did the Earth's waTyleter originally come from?
Much ofEarth's wateris thought to havecome fromasteroids impacting the planet early in its history. Image via NASA/Don Davis. The surface of the very youngEarthwasinitiallyan ocean of magma. Hydrogen and noble gases from the solar nebula were drawn to the planetary embryo, forming the first atmosphere."
L-EF,We need water because 75% of the human body is made out of water and also since plants need water and they give us oxygen and we need water to live and we get the oxygen from the plants and we give carbon dioxide back to the plants so basically almost everything need water.
L-EF,"I know that there is water in the ground. It is called ground water. If the people in Africa drank groundwater, would it be bad for them? I made this theory by knowing that the ground has dirt. Would people in Africa be drinking dirty water of would it be clean.
[    This theory cannot explain how the dirt is filtering the water because the soil has nitrates and the water Nya was drinking could have been bad for her because of thr high nitrate levels."
L-EF,The water cycle starts in a lake. water evaporates and goes into clouds. cloud gets dark nd fall of water and rains on land or lakes. water travels through underground. water ends up in the lake when land meets a lake.
L-F,"[    Putting our knowledge together  - When we worked in teams of 4/3, We made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange- ]"

L-EF,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part
L-EF,lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth
L-EF,transparent means full se through so nontransparent means opaque non see through
L-EF,aura borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to france or italy the natives feared them because they thought they were evil things
L-EF,photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light fact over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence
L-EF,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head
L-EF,those are the colors of your eye cones what i mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the secondary colors
L-EF,the secondary colors of light are made by mixing the primary colors of light here are the secondary colors of light yellow magenta and cyan here is how their made
L-EF,the northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter
L-EF,a transparent object is something you can see though like stephanie light can go right though it
L-EF,a translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light
L-EF,when you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows and the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear
L-EF,if you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue violet and indigo
L-EF,my understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light
L-EF,lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day
L-EF,the law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray
L-EF,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle
L-EF,convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated
L-EF,i also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent
L-EF,another one of the things i learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time they could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow
L-EF,when light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point
L-EF,lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world it can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything
L-EF,when white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow all the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-EF,chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light i used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence
L-EF,making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out an example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle
L-EF,a translucent object is not see through that means that you cant look through it but a little light can come through a translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer
L-EF,a concave mirror has a sort of cave shape we have mirrors that are flat the mirror that i am talking about is that mirror but pushed in this mirror looks like a bowl when you look into it you see a long shape of yourself
L-EF,a convex mirror is the very opposite this mirror is pushed out this mirror looks like a belly as we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down
L-EF,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided the light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head
L-EF,lasers are very bright and very strong they can go through anything if you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop
L-EF,to make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light shine all of the colors in the same spot then you will see white light here is a picture to make it more simple
L-EF,light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens whits is called diffused reflection
L-EF,to make a rainbow withs prism is simple just get a prism and go outside then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow but sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-EF,co lours of light you can make white light by mixing red green and blue primary colors of light light together
L-EF,the secondary colors of paint are orange green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other
L-EF,there are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes they are red green and blue they are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta
L-EF,the gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point that point is the meeting place of the light
L-EF,your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness in a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright but at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between
L-EF,the angle incidents equals the angle of reflection
L-EF,a defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror
L-EF,you have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue they are all sensitive to there own colors
L-EF,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally
L-EF,you have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone the red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light
L-EF,we have 3 different eye cones the 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue
L-EF,a concave mirror looks like a bowl when light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below
L-EF,there is some thing called the law of reflection the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror
L-EF,a diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror its when all the light goes in lots of directions
L-EF,objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous the sun is luminous as well
L-EF,cones are things that respond to colored light there are three kinds of light that cones respond to red blue and green
L-EF,light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light a prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-EF,there are different names for the colors of light those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light there not just named orally the primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors
L-EF,the primary colors are red blue and green the same colors as your eye cones
L-EF,a convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave
L-EF,a concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite
L-EF,a convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you a concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close
L-EF,you can add another lens to one of those lenses also a double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light
L-EF,there are two kinds of light natural and artificial natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs
L-EF,the second thing is fluorescence that is made with friction like when two stones rub together they make fire whits is heat and light that is fluorescence
L-EF,news flash if you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed
L-EF,and umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source that makes a big shadow that is pretty darker
L-EF,a penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source that makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter
L-EF,eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down the image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize
L-EF,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it all the colors will come out the other side
L-EF,an umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra
L-EF,shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are
L-EF,the rainbow is made up of colored light the colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
L-EF,there are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue
L-EF,a concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and
L-EF,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large
L-EF,when colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light
L-EF,sundials are a form of telling time you can tell the time by the position of the shadow
L-EF,shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in
L-EF,a concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused
L-EF,a convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking
L-EF,the penumbra is the light part of the shadow its a shadow plus a little light
L-EF,the secondary colors of light are yellow magenta and cyan there made by mixing the primary colors of light
L-EF,about colors when you look at a red object for at least 10 seconds and then look at a white suffuse and it will have the same shape but it will be green
L-EF,eye cones are in are eyes and some are sensitive to red blue and green and if the red con is not working then you cant see any thing to do with red or red
L-EF,an opaque object is a object is an object that you cant see through like metal opaque objects are uselessly the strongest material
L-EF,a convex lens is a lens that consent rats the light beam so when you look at the sore it will be a dot
L-EF,thats the ope sit of a concave lens it makes the light sored out you so if your flash light wont sored out then you can holed up a concave lens to the sore of light and it will sored out and cover a larger area but with less power
L-EF,the angle of incidents equals the angle of reflection that mens if you shine a light sore on a flare mirror then the angle you shewn the light on the mirror is the angle it will reflect
L-EF,a concave mirror is a spoon like mirror if you walk away from it you mig is upside down but if you walk closer then its right side up
L-EF,most lenses focuses light so if a weak but large source of light is being produced and you put a lens under it then it will make the weak light focus and become strong
L-EF,you make a rainbow with a prism if you put a source of light in front of a glass prism you usably don't see a perfect rainbow mane not even a rainbow but sometimes you can see a small rainbow
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror
L-EF,there are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror
L-EF,but there are two more basic ones one is the concave mirror this mirror looks like a cave it goes in and bounces light inside it
L-EF,if a shiny thing like tin foil is there but bent the law of reflection doesn't work the light goes all over the place
L-EF,convex mirrors make your vision all you can see in the area bigger so if you look in a convex mirror you will see a lot more behind you thees are used in places like cars
L-EF,your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but i have had light near and it was dark because i was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think i have benn there long enough but with no light i don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room
L-EF,a shadow wilel appear when you are facing north your shadow wilel be in front of you if you are facing south your shadow wilel be behind you and if you are facing east your shadow wile be on your right and if you are facing west your shadow is on your left
L-EF,when two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball one shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object
L-EF,there are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only there is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was christian huygens the other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines and there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves
L-EF,the next view is the co lours of light view with rainbows a rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow you can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-EF,thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks one of these sources is wintergreen life savers if you are chewing one turn the lights of look in a mirror while chewing look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks
L-EF,they also have something called the law of reflection the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection to clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle
L-EF,but first natural light there are two sections that i am going to write about first photoluminescence photoluminescence is made from a living thing like electric sale they make their own light therefore electric sale are electroluminescent so are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi
L-EF,we did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows first we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows
L-F,all of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light
L-F,a transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through
L-F,a translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through
L-F,an opaque object lets 0 through
L-F,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection
L-F,the secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple
L-F,red and blue make magenta
L-F,blue and green make cyan and
L-F,green and red make yellow
L-F,all three primary colors make white
L-F,light and materials the most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors but first mirrors there are two kinds of mirrors there names are concave and convex
L-F,you cant forget flat mirrors there sort of in the middle flat mirrors are pretty important to
L-F,that law only works for smooth mirrors though
L-F,on bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions that is a called a diffused reflection
L-F,now lenses there are two kinds of lenses concave and convex just like the mirrors they do the same things
L-F,lenses are transparent
L-F,there are two other forms that translucent and opaque
L-F,a transparent object means see through
L-F,a translucent object colors the light and
L-F,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely
L-F,now artificial light first chemiluminescence chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light
L-F,then there are lasers lasers are extremely bright and very strong they can go through anything
L-F,there are two different ways you can play with shadows one is an umbra and the other is a penumbra
L-F,those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things those things are eclipses there are two eclipses that we know of solar and lunar
L-F,3 is it true that we cant see without light of course not
L-F,the colors of light i think are in the rainbow winch are redorangeyellowgreenblueindigoand violet
L-F,the primary colors of pigment paint are bluebeard yellow
L-F,there are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial the kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers
L-F,photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves
L-F,the aurora borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive
L-F,fl you want to make white light you mix red blue and green together and you have white light
L-F,a lunar eclipse is when the earth is in front of the moon
L-F,a solar eclipse is when the moon goes in front of the earth
L-F,a concave mirror is a mirror that is bent in
L-F,a convex mirror is a mirror that is bent out
L-F,photoluminescence is made by animals whose habits don't have much light
L-F,misalliance is made by semicircles
L-F,transparent objects are objects that you see threw
L-F,translucent is when only some light can shine threw
L-F,concave mirrors reflect light out and convex mirrors footrace the light
L-F,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the light goes onto the mirror and bounces in the isopleth direction
