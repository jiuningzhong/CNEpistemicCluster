The Types of Edges.Almost all narrow, grasslike leaves and needles leaves have a blade with a smooth edge, as do many broadleaf plants, particularly those that are native to warm climates. The rubber plant, a common house plant, is a good example of such a plant.
The leaves of many temperate broadleaf plants have small, jagged points called teeth along the blade edge. Birch and elm trees have such leaves. Some plants havehydathodes, tiny valvelike structures that can release excess water from the leaf. The teeth of young leaves on many plants, including cottonwood and pin cherry trees, bear tiny glads. These glands produce liquids that protect the young leaf from plant-eating insects.
Some temperate broadleaf plants -- including sassafras trees and certain mulberry and oak trees -- have lobed leaves. The edge of such a leaf looks as if large bites have been taken out of it.

Primitive mosses, similar to the hundreds of moss species found in Appalachia, might have triggered two cool periods around 455 million years ago, according to a recent study.

L-X,but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,A lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,What is absorbing My understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white  Red Green and Blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,object,E-H
L-X,What is Reflecting My understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed Why I think there reflected is because its not the same color ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,object,E-H
L-X,this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,object,E-BS
L-X,New information A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon Since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,A solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what I just told you ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,The way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green What happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,With a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-H
L-X,The northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun The particles are so small you couldn't see them How they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-BS
L-X,Convex mirrors are used in stores They let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,reflection,E-BS
L-X,All we see is light the way I can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color Then the color bounces into your eye Three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,object,E-BS
L-X,I just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon The earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-S
L-X,This is how rainbows are made with rain The sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-S
L-X,I think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-BS
L-X,If you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface The color red is reflected But the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,My understanding about a Lunar eclipse is that when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon The Sun casts a shadow over the moon called a lunar eclipse ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,My theory's that light travels in a wave line because if you drive behind a bus you'll see heat that looks wave ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-H
L-X,Shadows A shadow is an inexact reflection of your body that shows on a very sunny day when you are outside You see your shadow when you happen to be outside and you look down at the ground Also your shadow touches you wherever you touch the ground ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-PS
L-X,We see a red rose when there is a flashlight or another light source that will shine on the rose and absorb the green and blue light and reflect the red light into our eyes ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-S
L-X,and how we see a yellow rose is that it is the same but the red and green light are reflected and blue is absorbed ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-S
L-X,How do you make a rainbow with rain The sky is still wet with raindrops and the sunlight shines through the drops and a rainbow forms in the sky Make a rainbow with a prism exactly the same way ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS
L-X,The northern lights are also called the aurora Borealis and they are lights in the sky that are mixtures of colors that are seen only in the northern parts of the world and that is why they are called the northern lights ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-H
L-X,Why are Northern Lights different colors Each gas in earths atmosphere glows with its own color when it becomes charged with electricity Oxygen gives off an eerie green glow nitrogen glows red and neon gas turns pink ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-S
L-X,I also learned that a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun which makes a large shadow over the earth That is why when your outside and the sun dispersals its just a large shadow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,I also learned that a lunar eclipse is caused when the earth is between the sun and the moon ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,Also if your looking at a yellow flower the blue light would be absorbed allowing the two other colors to both making yellow would bounce of into your two sensitive cone to those colors ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,The Northern lights are caused by the sun bombarding the earth with tiny partials of electricity When these partials hit the highest part of the hates atmosphere it electrolysis the air and makes it glow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-BS
L-X,To make a rainbow with rain it in voles moisture in the air and since there is moisture in the air the moistness acts like a prism ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS
L-X,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is right in between the sun and the moon winch casts a shadow over the moon making the moon total darkness ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,Solar panels are used for sucking up sunlight and using the sunlight for something such as a solar powered windmill That works by the sunlight getting sucked into a solar panel and the light moves the windmill ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,sunpanel,E-BS
L-X,A red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,object,E-BS
L-X,A yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,object,E-BS
L-X,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,Inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy This energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy The process of giving off light is called incandescence ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,glow,E-BS
L-X,You have three eye cones in your eyes One is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,postimage,E-BS
L-X,When we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,My understanding of Light The colors of light Light is made up of many many different colors You cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light White light is transparent so you cant see it ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,pri&sec,E-H
L-X,When it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS
L-X,That is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,There are also things called solar panels They are made to catch light The light that they catch is used to make electricity Solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,sunpanel,E-BS
L-X,A shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent When a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-S
L-X,A lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun The sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-S
L-X,A solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-S
L-X,People make shadows by just standing in the light Because light travels in a titrate line or Waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-S
L-X,Shadow My theory is that all the light gets around but it doesn't get past your body so it is dark and the shape of your body ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-H
L-X,A solar eclipse it happens when the moon is located between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the sunlight ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-S
L-X,Solar energy Solar panels are dark so they attract heat and the sun is turned into thermal energy In the panels there are little tubes and the water gets warmer the warm water is pumped into a storage tank and it heats the house ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,sunpanel,E-BS
L-X,The Northern lights are red pink ghostly greens the Northern lights happen when the sun bombards earth with particles that are electric When they hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and it glows ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-BS
L-X,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the moon and the sun in which the sun shines on earth and makes a shadow on the moon which makes the moon in total darkness ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,If a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when I did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights I didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-H
L-X,There are two types of eclipses The rift one is called a solar eclipse Its when the moon goes in front of the earth and behind the sun which casts a shadow upon earth As I said before an opaque object like the moon and the sun is the light source it makes a shadow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-X,this is how we see a yellow rose the white light hits the rose green and red are reflected and blue is absorbed why green and red are reflected incited of just one color is because yellow is a secondary color and are brain sees the rose upside down and backwards ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,object,E-H
L-X,Diffused reflection is when a ray of light comes and hits something like bumpy tinfoil The light comes and egos everywhere because it has more than one thing to bounce off of it It egos up down right left because when its bumpy it goes like that because of different bumps ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,diffused,E-BS
L-X,Here is how solar panels work Dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light The dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy The thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan That means that black attracts heat ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,sunpanel,E-S
L-X,this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light The glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall When you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us These 2 things are all plugd into a wall ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,electric,E-H
L-X,The picture I drew was making a rainbow out of a prism This picture is with two prisms this is how it works If you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again This is How to make white light through a viable spectrum ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,prism,E-BS
L-X,Also you can see a green object because white light shines on that object white light has red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet in it and the object absorbs all the colors except green which is reflected into the eyes of the person that is looking at the object ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-S
L-X,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the incident ray goes on the mirror and makes the angle of incidence There is an invisible line between the angle and ray of incidence and the angle and ray of reflection The reflection ray is the reflection of the incident ray ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,reflection,E-BS
L-X,The Northern Lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky They occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity too small for us to see When these particles hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and make it glow ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-S
L-X,My theory's that light travels in waves because when we did an experiment with progesterone and a tennis ball hanging from the vealing on a piece of string And when we shone light on it the tennis balls shader was clear But the strings shadow had some light on it ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-BS
L-X,Dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light so they are perfect for solar panels instead they absorb the suns rays and turn them into thermal energy this means that on a roof there are dark hoses of water  The water heats up because the hoses are absorbing the suns rays and they are isolated The heated water is pumped into a storage tank where it used to heat the house  ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,sunpanel,E-S
L-X,When looking at a red rose you need light right You do so when your looking at that objetc the light shines on it and since it is red it refletcs the red light off the objetc and all the other colors get absorbed Its the same with any other color including yellow green etc ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-X,Shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object If the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror If there is no light there isn't a shadow So there is a shadow where the light cant reach ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-BS
L-X,When we had the class debate I was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves And now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this Light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight That means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves It depends on how you look at it Or what your experiment is trying to prove In our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines Thomas Young experiment ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-S
L-X,The way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color The green light keeps going until it goes into your eye Then the brain identifies what color and it is ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-S
L-X,Cones tire easily If you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired So when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple And purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,postimage,E-BS
L-X,This is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order As you know there are seven colors that we know of They all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed But when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed For some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS
L-X,A thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights This happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun The sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic The earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow The colors that glow are red pink and green ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-BS
L-X,1 How do you think light travels My theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going My theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines Like a flashlight That also explains why light is hot ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-H
