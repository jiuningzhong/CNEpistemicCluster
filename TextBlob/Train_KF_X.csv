L-E,[    A better theory  - is like how an ants or whatever are working or somthing couse you can wach videos- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - Do you know energy carries all the time.right now energy is being carried from a plant to little animal to big animal back to little animal to soil and it repeats agian and again.- ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - I think worker ants do most of the work, the worker ants would be building the ant hill. I agree that the ant hills would be made out of dirt too.- ]"
L-E,[    My theory  - if ants build ant houses and they carrie the grains of sand won't they fall of- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - if you need any ideas dont water the ants. Ants could die if waters hits ants. build just a few ant hills. Because thousands of ants live in one ant hill
L-E,"[    My theory  - Is i think if you wanna see if it is a living. It has to grow somthing and need water to live..- ]    
[    New Information  -A non living thing does not need water to survive.- ]"
L-E,"[    My theory  - Is if a venomous or poisonous animal eats another venomous or poisonous animal, some will survive, and some will maybe die. some animals eat venomous or poisonous animal as a food sourse, but maybe another animal can't survive it.- ]"
L-E,"[    My theory  - is if you crush a seed and give it water, soil and sun it will grow- ]"
L-E,[    My theory  - is it flips over- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is many apples rot because the weather is changing - ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is maybe that the male might become king of the ants- ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - is over time, I think that the stem of the apple gets weaker and weaker, and sometimes the wind might blow the apple off the tree and probably some animals nock them off too.- ]"
L-E,[    My theory  - is that a bird or animal flys over and drops it into the courtyard and then lays eggs that make more spider which make more and more and more until they go exsticked or the eco system dies.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - Is that air works to clean up are ecostyem by blowing dead leaves away or to barry it - ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that an Anthill is prepared by worker ants that are strong. (Like not ants that are just born)- ]    
[    A better theory  - Is that the Queen ant could get a part of a different colony who the queen says in Ant Language could say ""Build me an Anthill!""]"
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that animanles clime under ground to the court yard and eat bugs and frogs other animales to how do all those other animanles
- ]"
L-E,[    My theory  - is that birds carry them over- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that I usually see moss on the dark areas of trees. So I am thinking it forms on dark areas. I also think it forms when its dewy and wet.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that if a predetor is close it will turn over to blend in- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that if moss dies out then it will create a problem wave in the ecosydom many animals will die and plants will to because it provides water on those hot days when there is no water- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that it will still live but it cant do thing as fast it will walk way slower and it may die because it cant get to food on time.- ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that jaguars don't really eat chimpanzees, and that people from africa don't kill and eat jaguars... but I think that chimpanzees might eat ants. Good work overall.- ]"
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that mabye 2 grass hoppers went arcross the top of the building and had a lot of kids (grass hoppers) and thats how- ]    
- ]    
[    This theory cannot explain  - how the grass hoppers made it across- ]"
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that maybe plants
make food. The roots also need air so they can get nutrients and Plants need air. They use the carbon dioxide in the air for water because there is 1% of water in air. It is called photosynthesis. (some info from google.)
- ]"
L-E,[    New Information  - All ants have different jobs. As they grow they get darker.Ants go faster since they have tiny legs.there can be a thousands of ants in a anthill. If a ant get feed the right things they can be a queen.- ]
L-E,"[    New Information  - Almost every ecosystem needs soil for their environment. Soil is a massive help towards growing plants and being homes towards many insects. Without soil, plants wouldn't grow and the food web would go wack without all the producers/plants. - ]"
L-E,"[    New Information  - Almost every ecosystem needs water, to grow its enviornment and its whole species. Every animal needs water, plants need it in order to grow too. Without plants in the food chain, it would go wack, making a species over populated and then go extinct. - ]"
L-E,"[    New Information  - I learned is that abiotic means decomposition by a chemical process, and that biotic means decomposition of living orgonisms.- ]"
L-E,"[    New Information  - Peat is formed by decaying moss and plants. This is important because peat is a fuel. It can be used for fertilizer, burn for fuel, and eventually, it becomes coal.- ]"
L-E,"[    New Information  - The sun provides humankind with light and heat to create new earth habitate. It also provides plants to grow to help the food chain. Sunlight also helps with weather, which weather helps ecosystems too. Sunlight can cause droughts when there is less rain and intense rain.- ]"
L-E,[    New Information  - You can tell how old a tree is if you cut it open a bit you see circles 1 circle for every year- ]
L-E,[    New Information  -When ants die the other ants leave it alone but after two days they carry it to the ant graveyard. They do this because after two days it starts to smell which gives signals to the ants that it is dead.
L-E,"<blockquote>

I learned that the food chain is what connects animals.
[    My theory  - is that the food chain is in regions because pandas are only in Asia so something in antarica can't eat it.
[    A better theory  - I have is that somehing in both places can connect them. Mabey something that live in one place gets eaten by something tat lives there and in another place and that animal gets eaten by anther animal.- ]

L-E,"a plant can grow without real sunlight but if you dont have real sunlight it has to grow withartificial sunlight (lamp,light,night light) but a plant can not grow without sunlight"
L-E,"A species is a group of organisms that are so alike they classify as a group,to be a type of species the organisms have to be able to reproduce for example a Mule is not a species because it is not able to reproduce."
L-E,Air+water+sunlight=wind water makes clouds and if you add too much wind you'll make a thunderstorm or atornado
L-E,"All moss needs to haveSPORES to live cause
that is how water and air gets into the Moss
or the plant"
L-E,All plants usesunlightto make food (sugars) in a process called photosynthesis
L-E,another reason why living things need energy is because if you don´t eat you can starve and cannot live
L-E,"ants are super strong, so they dig the hole quiqly even after it gets destroyed"
L-E,apples fall off the trees in winter because they get weak.
L-E,Atoms are small particles (building blocks) that are everywhere. They are made up of a central dense nucleus which is surrounded by one or some more lightweight negativity charged particles that are called electrons.
L-E,"carbon is everything, without carbon there would be no universe"
L-E,"Decomposersbreak down the remains of dead plants and animals and, in doing so, releasecarbon dioxidethrough respiration."
L-E,energy can come from the sun and fossil fules and the suns energy is the main source of life like the plants convert it into food for them. and then an anamail comes along and eats the plant and absobs the energy.
L-E,first apple trees need sun light to grow and the rain then it keeps growing and growing untill it becomes a big apple tree with tasty apples on it
L-E,flamingos are born gray but they eat a type of plant and a type of mineral in the plant turns the flamigo pink. it should be the same with ants
L-E,I agree with Varsha becasue I onlny see moss on tree bark and the ground/dirt.
L-E,"I agree with you, because trees and plants can not live with out chlorophyll."
L-E,"I also think that the moss grows to the north, because the north is colder and moss usually grows in cool and wet conditions."
L-E,I also think that the moss is effected by the tree position.
L-E,"I Can Add On To That Beacuse When The Weather Is Putting The Pressure On To The Apple And Making It Fall Off The Tree Its Like When Someone Were To Push You Off The Edge Of A Pool, The Pressure Of The Person Pushing You Is Putting Impact On Your Boby And Therefore Making You Fall Into The Pool. Also I Agree With You Saying That If A Person Were Sick Its Like An Apple Slowly Rotting Because It Dosn't Have The Nutrients To Grow Off Of."
L-E,I can add on to that because when weather puts the pressure on the matter it can make it transfer into a different shape or fall apart like if there was a Tsunami the waves are so strong that they can make houses and buildings fall apart and it can squish cars and make them flat or put them into a different shape or like when you pour water into a cup it takes the form of the cup.
L-E,I dissigry they carry sand one by one I think.
L-E,I don't think plants have energy I think they have nurtrients that turns in to fuel/energy for the thing thats eats them.
L-E,"I don't think the moss will die out because when moss dies, it will become rich soil for new mosses and plants to grow."
L-E,I dont think metal ever lived.
L-E,I dont think so because what if a bee died in it?
L-E,"I learned tha there are over 12,000 types of ants. Also they are soical insects witch mean they move in larage groups."
L-E,I noticed that maybe only some trees have moss growing to the north maybe like a compass moss will grow to the north because there is something there what is that something
L-E,"i predict that the moss on the ground will keep growing if it gets water and sun or else it will die .
[    My theory  - is that the cold weather and the rain will keep it alive . Or the rain will sit there and the cold will freeze it- ]"
L-E,I think once the ivy interacts with the skin it will infect the outside layer of skin and the Interaction will cause an infection from bolth the ivy and the skin and that will create the rash. :)
L-E,"I think that the weather is making the apples fall down beacause the wind is putting preser on the apple.
[    My theory  - is that when the apples fall down they rot because they don't get the nuterents they need- ]    
[    I need to understand  - that the applesare like people if the don't get there nutrents they get sick.- ]"
L-E,"I think that there is nutrients in thing animals eat that give them energy, if they can't get energy they might be a canirvor if it's a plant because they can't convert those nutrients"
L-E,I think you miss understand what spores are. Spores are kind of like the seeds for moss exept there´re microscphic.
L-E,I think your 2 answer is correct and that it is probably a different type of moss
L-E,if a feamle ants eat the right food they turn into queen ants
L-E,if an ant eats the right kind of food it can become a queen ant!
L-E,In Photosynethesis the plant will use energy from the sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into simple sugars. A plant needs water and sunlight for food.
L-E,In the daytime the hot air comes from the river and than it goes up in the air and than the cold air replaces it. In the courtyard when its about to be winter the nights are cold but in the summer the nights are worm by the ways the air cycle in the daytie is the opposite of the air cycle in the nightime.
L-E,IS tHAT the green side might be for camofloging with the leef and brown side for sand
L-E,it interacts with humans because if it is contagous than it can spred around if you tuch it.
L-E,it probably grew like that over time.Maybe something happened to it.
L-E,leaves absorbe the sun light and water and creates the suger that it uses to live .
L-E,maybe a cherry tree or some type of trees full of fruits.
L-E,Maybe small animals like ants for a nest or a birdwhen the moss is on the tree the bird might use it for it's nest.
L-E,"Maybe The Ant That Eats the right food will not be the king because it dosen't lay babies.
But it can lead the other ants to find another group with a queen!"
L-E,Maybe there is somethingattracting the moss so it goes north?
L-E,Mosquioes are the most different creature on the planet because its one of the only living creature carry diseases
L-E,Moss only grows on the northern side of tress if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere.If the tree lives in the southern hemisphere the moss grows on the southern side of trees
L-E,Moss will grow better in damper places because it takes in all the water in the air.
L-E,"Most animals need water to survive, water allows metabolism occur which is the process that drives all the biochemical reaction that take places in cells"
L-E,"Most likely, it would not grow. Just because that the roots are whatSTARTthe process for the tree to grow.
[    My theory  - mostly, is that the tree will not grow anymore, but will still live... Unless you cut it or it falls.- ]"
L-E,"My theory is you can feel the sun on you even if itś far away because the rays give off a whole lot of energy, the sun reflects on a cloud and a cloud shoots to the ground like a mirror"
L-E,My theroy is that white soil interacts with the plants the same as brown/regular does because I have observed NO CHANGE between either white soil or regular/brown soil. My hypothisis is that they are just diffrent colors and I do not think that that change makes a diffrence of how they grow.
L-E,"no, because metal is not madde out of anything living."
L-E,noah another term is apex prdetor Wich means top of the food web
L-E,"out side in the courtyard I found a brick wih a small patch of moss in the middle of the brick touching no other patches of moss
[    I need to understand  - how the moss lives- ]    
[    This theory cannot explain  - because I have not gatherd enough informaition- ]"
L-E,Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to create foods from carbon dioxide and water.
L-E,"Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy. Here, we describe the general principles of photosynthesis and highlight how scientists are studying this natural process to help develop clean fuels and sources of renewable energy."
L-E,"Poison in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac is called urushiol and it is used to protect the plant. NEVER burn the plant, because if the urushiol gets in the air and you breathe it in, it will most likely kill you."
L-E,Rhizoids are the super thin roots that hold the moss in place. They aren´t very strong so you could pick it up without struggle.
L-E,"Serena:an egg is clear then it turns white when it is older then the baby is clear and gets its coloRS when it's older
Camryn a baby is clear till it gets older than they turn a dark brown"
L-E,Some caterpillars like monarchs eat milkweed leaves so that they can scare there predators off and so they dont get eaten
L-E,"Some flowers are very sweet-smelling, and they originally grew thorns to protect themselves from animals that may try to eat them. So my theory is that they they may have been for protection, like you said."
L-E,spiders eat insects and get eaten by birds and fish so spiders are first level predators but not apex predators
L-E,"Spores are carried by the wind. Then, it grows into moss."
L-E,"The apple rots because the enrgery from the tree put it into the apple when it was on the tree and when said apple fell off of the tree,it didn't get any more ""food"" from the tree so it will rot and die then posibly get eaten."
L-E,the bettle has a brown side for camiflouge and the green side is for that if camiflouge fails it can turn around to show the brigh green side to try to scare away the preadator
L-E,the energy is still being produced because if it stoped the tree would die. the leaves are probably are getting weak and dry because the cold.
L-E,the female moquitos spit on your skin to num up your skin were it smells/looks sweeet and suger filled and then they put their sharp nose in your skin and find a blood vesel and suck out your blood.
L-E,The freezing and cold tempretures will kill the moss. and the rain will help it grow.
L-E,The plant also useswater from rain and carbon for the process to work for the gluocose like a cooking recipe
L-E,"there are diffrent types of moss such asiron moss wich will only grow on thigs with heavy amounts of iron on it
[    My theory  - is that the moss only sticks to certain things- ]    
your friend Sienna (:"
L-E,"There can be a lot of different animals.
[    New Information  - insects are anials too.- ]     If insect are animals there is so many types of animals like grass hoppers,ants mousqutioand other different insects ."
L-E,They give plants energy and animals eat that plant so they get energy and so on.
L-E,"They Need Sugar So They Could Make Fruits And My Question Is How Do The Plants Make Sugar
Photo=Light And Synthesis=Putting Toghether
Leaves Have Tiny Pores Called Stomata So Carbon Dioxide Can enter the plant"
L-E,"Toads can burrow if there is a predotor or a emergency, maybe thats where toads go when its winter, under ground."
L-E,"when do the mosquitos stop drinkings the blood? well, that's a good question. etheir the mosquito's stomach gets full, or, it gets spotted and flys away quickly, or dies because it got swatted by somebody."
L-E,When the apple falls from the tree it gets a bruise then the decomposers build o to the bruise and takes the energy from the apple then the apple rots
L-E,When the apples fall they interact with the air because the apple is falling through the air.when it falls to the ground it is interacting with leaves. Over time the apple will interact with decomposers. The decomposers interact with the apple by eating it so it get rotten.
L-E,when they dig the ants push dirt out to make tunnles witch makes a ant hill like when you dig with a tunnle
L-E,when they fall of the tree than they cant grow any more like a human when a human eats and than grows and you grow till you cant grow any more than advetually die so thats the same with apples
L-E,"Why are baby ants white when their born and then they turn to their regular ant colony color and not just be born the same color as their ant colony? What I did learn though is that when the ants are born they have no legs and can't do anything without the help of the other ant or so called worker ants.
[    My theory  - Is if the baby ants are born without legs and can't do anything by itself maybe that has to do with why its color is white. Also if their decomposers maybe something from that equals to why the baby abts are born white and if they eat te right type of foods they can turn to their regular coloies colors.- ]"
L-E,"yes
[    My theory  - is- ]     yes during oter sesings in winter ther fur might white or oter colers"

When a tardigrade is dry up it starts to synthesize special molecules which fill the tardigrades cells to replace lost water by forming a matrix,
A matrix is like a net the marix keeps cells from the tardigrade from moving or combining"
L-E,[    A better theory  - I think ant hills are living because the are in are ecosystem and they are ecsposed to air to live- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - A Daddy long legs fangs are to short to bite people but there tails are have been so deadly with venom.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that maybe the berries are a source of food to the stink bugs and that's why they were all over the berries.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that moss lets go clusters of seeds into the air and let the wind carry it away- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that spiders can climb up walls because they shoot a spider web up and climb it and the web is sticky-]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that the enviormet is good here at this time .- ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that the ground hog that we saw might live here in guilderland because there are nutrients maybe here so that is why i am searching wy groundhogs live in guilderland- ]    
[    This theory cannot explain  - why ground hogs live in guilderland- ]"
L-E,[    My theory  - is that the moss might have got stuck on the brick somehow and there might have some water on it that might keep it sticking if you look in google how it gets stuck on the brick and gets nutrients from it might help - ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that there are all kinds of diffrent cattipilers but there is only one kind that i know that is piosenes and it is white with black spikes and it is really cool iv seen one or two before and thoes are the most dangoures cattipilers that i know .- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that there is oil on the poison ivy that makes you ich and there is alot of diffrent ways it can get in any were at any time at any place .- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that they are poisonis because they eat stuff that makes them poison is- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that they eat anamals that cant hert them that much- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that they go down deep so preditors will not eat them- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that they NEED food to survive!!- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that they need there fur to survive and water food.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is that they still could live because they would still have a lot of their legs and most likely 2 legs would not through them of ballance- ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that weather is a super strong force that uses lots of different matter like wind, water,houses and more.- ]     weather can c HH znge a lot of things. LIke people if it always snowed no crops could grow and all living things would die out."
L-E,[    My theory  - is the apple fell of the tree and the decomposers eat the apple and the apple got less energy and rotted.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is the spider might still live for ages because a spider needs equal legs- ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - is the thorns are usedto keep plant eating animals away.- ]    
we should work together on this wondering"
L-E,[    My theory  - is there might have been nutrients on the bery so that must be why- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - is they might crall over the school like going on it and crall on to the roof to go in the courtYARD - ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - is- ]    
Apples fall because of gravity. The apple falls when it gets ripe. Once it is ripe it gets weak around the stem and the gravity pulls it down to the ground"
L-E,"[    My theory  - is- ]     toads do not go undergrond because they do not go undergrond
they go into a state of hibernation, and somecanbe exposed to temperatures below freezing. Aquatic"
L-E,"[    My theory  - Is, that the white and black catipiller is piosonous.- ]    
But some one else thinks there is another black and white catipiller in florida but I disagree."
L-E,[    My theory  - it is probably damp there to because it is dark and that stops the sun from drying it so maybe it grows in dark and damp places - ]
L-E,[    My theory  - mosquitos are the most deady creatures in the world. they can cary thousands of deiseases.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - Moss grows on the north side of trees because water evaporates on the north side of the tree.In the southern hemisphere water evaporates on the south side of trees.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - my theory is that ants find the hills and just put hole and the top the dont build the hills- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - of why the stinkbugs are not moving when they are on the berries is maybe they want it as their source of food and the stinkbugs don't want the other stinkbugs getting over the berries. Also maybe since it's getting colder the stinkbugs want to get as much food as they can because it will be a lot colder and the stinkbugs will lose their sources of food.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  - poison is used to scare predetors away or else the predotor will dye slowly- ]
L-E,"[    My theory  - Seeds are living matter.Because Seeds in apples are like unborn children they dont grow but when they get the right treatment they grow into a huge apple tree.

L-E,[    My theory  -Mosquitos are the most deadly animals in the world.they cary thousands of diseases.- ]
L-E,[    My theory  -Moss does not only grow on the north side of trees. Moss grows on the north side of trees if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere. the reason for this because the sun hits the north side of trees so water evaporates. So moss grows. if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere. it grows on the south side. - ]

L-E,"Anthony, female mosquitos are the only mosquitos that drink blood, because they need nutrients for their eggs. male mosquitos are harmless and instead eat nectar"
L-E,"I agree with Owian, but I think that the ants do a few grains of sand/dirt at a time."
L-E,I agree with Serena because the plants made no progress over the weekend. So I will also check with Serena if the plants made any progress on the 7th of December and\or 10th of December.
L-E,"I noticed that ants were crawling around sand and there was a ant hole.
[    I need to understand - how living underground impacts ants and what impacts ants living underground.
[    My theory  - is that snow and rain impacts ants living underground by bringing the ant hole down. Also does warm weather impact ants living underground also."
L-E,"I noticed that moss does not have seeds.
[    I need to understand  - that why does moss grow if it does not have seeds so it can grow.
[    My theory  - is moss is growing because a reaction that supposedly it makes moss grow.- ]

L-E,"I noticed that moss was growing on the trees.
[    I need to understand  - Why does moss grow on the tree?- 
[    My theory  - Maybe the weather effects the moss or the light. ]"
L-E,"I noticed that some plants in the courtyard are rotting,
[    I need to understand  -- ]    
- what causes living plants to interact with the rotting plants]    
[    My theory  -- ]    
- is that the rotting plants decay into the soil and the living plants use the soil to grow.]"
L-E,"I noticed that the moss was get larger and larger as it spread
[    I need to understand  - how and why does moss spread to other things around it
- ]    
[    My theory  - is that moss spread more cause it grows to the round and evantually reaches other objects- ]"
L-E,"i noticed that there was more moss on the sides of the boards on the bench then on the top.
[    I need to understand  - if the moss grows better in the shade than in the sun.- ]    
[    My theory  -is that the moss needs to be in a dark and moist place. This might be why it sometimes grows on wood- ]"
L-E,"I noticed that when the wind blow the leaves fell off the tree.
[    I need to understand  - why the weather effects living and non-living matter in the GES ecosytem?- ]    
[    My theory  - is thay when the weather puts presure on the matter like hail,rain or wind the matter falls,flattens or moves, like when you get pushed you fall forward.- ]"
L-E,"I noticed the apple tree had some leaves that were green and some were yellow.
[    I need to understand  - why the leaves are different colors. I know the temperature is getting cooler. Does that impact the way the tree changes?
[    My theory  - is that the leaves will eventually get so old they turn colors like my hair is so old it has turned gray.- ]    
- ]"
L-E,i think a few years at most
L-E,I think berry trees have red stuff on it.
L-E,I think moss forms in dark areas because it grows on dark spot on trees
L-E,I think spiders climb walls by gripping into cracks with their legs.
L-E,in other cases there would be making it moss because i just realized that moss cant grow seeds but plants can
L-E,the sun will allways be a mystriye because nobody has even gotten anywhere near the sun without dieing
L-E,well jack you see air you see it everywhere. and air s everthing. and plus air is the first thing that you see in the morning when you wake up!
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that most water are dirty in villages, and If we install filters in villages so they can be clean.- ]"
L-E,It might be because they don't have the resources.
L-E,"I think it's because there is not a lot of bodies of water,and they have a lot of 3rd world countries that can not afford wells."
L-E,some countries don't have the water they need because the dont have the equipment to filter and distribute it to more people.
L-E,some countries also don't have much water because of a drout or of a water shortage from a war or hot weather.
L-E,"Maybe we can install underground pipes, that go to all of the villages, and then the water can go through a filter, and be cleaned and ready to drink."
L-E,So my theroy is that we could we can put water towers in different areas then we put pipes in
L-E,They should filter the water if its dirty so it's healthy or add pipes around so it's not as hard to get water
L-E,what weill happed if you drink too much water? will you be fine?
L-E,"My theory is that if you drank only sugar drinks for 2 weeks, these could be some of the results:
*You might get diabetes
*Your teethmight rot and fall out
*You might have a hyperactivity seizure
*Your organs might get weaker because they had too much sugar energy and shorted out.
*You would gain a lot of weight
*You might get dehydrated if there is caffeine in your drinks.
*Your blood sugars can spike and drop, making you hyper and tired."
L-E,I think what would happen is it could/would dmage your teeth and youcould get diabetes like Erica said. You may not be able to survive. It may be like drinking saltwater instead of regular water. You can't survive if you just drink saltwater.
L-E,Africa's water dries up more quickly because they are closer to the equator.
L-E,yes thatsn right but some of the gose to the trees and dose not dry up and it stays under ground
L-E,"[    My theory  - is that Soda is way unhealither than Water.- ]    
Soda has Sugar and other unhealther products.
Water has... just water.
Is there any other differences?"
L-E,"[    My theory  - The Water comes from graciers, lakes, groundwaters, swamps, and river.- ]"
L-E,"[    My theory  - is most likely that water doesn't have a lot of flavor (like ingredients), and Soda (let's say, Dr. Pepper) has like a Caramel Color or like Caffiene (idk how to spell it) so that is how.- ]"
L-E,[    My theory  - is that it has to do with chemestrey- ]
L-E,"I dont think we can make water.
We get our water from the rain or ground water and other types of ways, these are like the types of ways we get water"
L-E,"We know how to make water but its really hard and there are lots of complications.
( google it )"
L-E,"Would we take the time just to make water when it rains every once in a while, and google doesn't know everything"
L-E,"I didnt say we should do it I said we know but theres lots of complications.
(I ment google it and find a website)"
L-E,"Again I didnt say that humans should start making water. and ocean water has salt in it if we drink too much humans will die. thats what some people are trying to figure out, how to get salt out of the salt water. but your obviously not listening.
(I know google dosnt know everything I said find a website)"
L-E,[    My theory  - is that if we find a way to filter saltwater it could help humans- ]
L-E,hey timy they already made a filter that can trancfer the salt out of salt water
L-E,[    Putting our knowledge together  - If there is already something that can get the salt out of salt water than we would not be having this unit- ]
L-E,The reason why is that it is very expensive to desalinate water
L-E,[    My theory we can use ships to get it to poor courtys or bulid pips ouder nith the ocan to carry the water
L-E,I know that 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom also known as h2o. So if we combine those I think we might get water.
L-E,"If we put 2/3 hydrogen and 1/3 oxygen in a container, then we might turn out with water. If we can get a big chunk of a glacier, then we can melt it and give more water to countries in need."
L-E,"We can not bind the two,but I was thinking the same thing about both."
L-E,what if we had fiters that can filter the salt out of salt water oh wait we do so why can´t we just take a lot of those filter and put thenm all around the world and then peopl can get fresh water all the time and the fresh water can go to alot of good cause and all those cause are food and health .
L-E,[    My theory  - is that we should build filters in big factories and transport water all around the world and check if the filters take out the salt in the water.- ]
L-E,"One way to get fresh water is to melt glaciers into water. I know this because if you melt snow or ice, it becomes water."
L-E,[    Putting our knowledge together  - Just think about how much water we actually have in this world compared to the salt water. Salt water is poisen thats why we sweat salt water and pee salt water. This is also why your pee is yellow. If its clear then you need to drink water.- ]
L-E,"I do not think salt water is POISONOUS but we can not use it. Also pee and sweat, as far as I know are not salt water."
L-E,You can create water but it would be dangrass and we might loose osgyan.
L-E,"[    Putting our knowledge together  - I know that people need clean water in order to stay nice and healthy. Otherwise, if people drink dirty water, people is going to be sick or pass away.- ]"
L-E,"Water is importent to us for many reasons. So why are wedestroying it and filling it with garbage?
[    My theory  - is that people don't know where to put it so we dump it in water that we can use for many things but we people think that our garbage is going some place that is ok but we don't know whats actually happening cause we don't get telled we're basically being lied to in the face.- ]     I think we should do something about that."
L-E,Water pollution is the contamination of bodies of water usually caused by humans. Water pollution happens when contaminants get into the water source.
L-E,because we cant servive without water!!!
L-E,"There is soething called the water table, It is under all the soil. its at the way bottem. Do you know what satured means? Grab a spunge and dip it in a bowl of water, Squeez it and all the water will spill out. if a drop of rain drops on to the soil or durt, The drop of water will evaporate into the air. When water squirts out of the soil/durt its calld a spring just like in tuck everlasting."
L-E,"[    My theory  - is- ]     that water is way heather than soda
[    A better theory  - is- ]     soda has a lot of calerles and water is way beter than soda and milk is better than"
L-E,[    My theory  - I read a book and it said that if there were no moon there would be no waves is that true? And if it was true Why?- ]
L-E,"The fruit would need water,I think it would have water in it,and if it has added sugar or sweetner that would need water to,so I don't think so. Plus water is better for you."
L-E,No because water does not carry sugar. Juice carry's a ton of sugar and its not that healthy.
L-E,I got a great idea. If helicopters scooped up water with giant water tanks. wouldn't that help people who need water
L-E,People need water to hydrate.
L-E,The reason why we need water is because we wont be able to servive. Water is more important than food because food just helps your stomach. Water keeps you alive and water keeps all the animals and plants alive too.
L-E,"Water is much more healthier than soda. I know this because soda has a lot of sugar in it, But water doesn't have sugar."
L-E,[    Putting our knowledge together  - Soda can also weaken you teeth and bones. Water is good for you + water can hydrate you.- ]
L-E,Many people cannot get to water because of water scarcity. I think water scarcity is when people can't get water. I think that also most people don't know how to get water because they don't have the proper education. Like how Nya didn't know how to get water from under the ground because she did not know.
L-E,"Even if we get ground water, we still need to filter it."
L-E,How a shadow is made a light nose on a big object 
L-E,Rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms 
L-E,The order of colors in the rainbow goes Red Orange yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave 
L-E,This is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye 
L-E,its the same with magenta except blue  red nonces off 
L-E,its also the same with cyan except blue  green light bounces off 
L-E,Shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow The shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object 
L-E,It depends on the time of day for the size of the shadow 
L-E,a convex lens also helps focus the light  
L-E,It dost focus the light  
L-E,If you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water 
L-E,Wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose 
L-E,Wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow The blue is absorbed and you cant see it 
L-E,Other Lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow 
L-E,A liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth 
L-E,Light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves 
L-E,Light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line It was proved by many people a long time ago 
L-E,A shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow 
L-E,Solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on 
L-E,You have three eye cones in your eyes to SEe different couplers like I said before the easy way to SE many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green 
L-E,glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work 
L-E,A shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object To see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red 
L-E,This is how a shadow is made  a shadow is made when light hits an object 
L-E,This is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow
L-E,how we make a rainbow with rain  After it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow 
L-E,Solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy 
L-E,My theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves 
L-E,My theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light 
L-E,the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits 
L-E,My understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that Red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest 
L-E,Anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected 
L-E,Rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops The raindrops acts as prisms 
L-E,other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction 
L-E,If you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came 
L-E,I learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth 
L-E,A shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow 
L-E,I also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity 
L-E,The northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth 
L-E,If you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green 
L-E,If you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected 
L-E,When you see a rainbow  you only see half of it A rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see 
L-E,If you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black 
L-E,Fluorescence objects are glow in the dark objects A sea animal that lives under the water is glow in the dark and glow in the dark star stickers and bandages Fluorescence objects are made be friction like two rocks rubbing together 
L-E,A lunar eclipse is when the moon covers the sun Long time ago a man predicted that there would be a lunar eclipse and he was right 
L-E,A Solar eclipse is when the sun covers the moon 
L-E,My understanding about Shadows is that when light hits you it creates a shadow My theory is that the light hits you and goes around you to make a shadow Heres a picture to make it more simple 
L-E,Also they react like chemiluminescence witch is a process of changing chemic energy into light energy 
L-E,Solar panels absorb sun light rays and turn them into energy 
L-E,To reflect colors the object has to be the same color to reflect the light colorTo absorb light color the object has to be not the same color to be absorb 
L-E,I think that light travels in straight lines and some other people think that light travels in waves I also think that light is a wave but it travels in straight lines I think light travels in straight lines in two ways 
L-E,A rainbows are made by raindrops that act like a prism that make the rainbow 
L-E,If you look at a green apple for a long time the green cone gets tired but the red and blue are not tired and together red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite color of green 
L-E,Most things that glow have some fluorescent paint on them This paint absorbs light and then glows until it has no more light absorbed in it 
L-E,A shadow is made when darkness made when light shines on a opaque object  
L-E,A liner eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the moon is between the sun and the earth 
L-E,A shadow is made when a light source hits an object 
L-E,A lunar eclipse is when the sun foe between the moon and casts a shadow 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon 
L-E,I need to understand why you can get two different kinds of shadows one that is larger than you and one that is smaller than you my theory of what happens is that it appends on the time of day 
L-E,What helps things that glow are fluorescence pink and other colors 
L-E,If your body wants to see a red rose the red is bounced into your eyes and the other colors are absorbs 
L-E,If your body wants to see a yellow green and red is bounced into you eyes and the blue is absorbed 
L-E,Solar panels takes in light and makes it in to energy 
L-E,My understanding shadows starts at the shadow view if a light sours hits a optic nontransparent object which creates a shadow Such as a person is standing behind a light sours and a shadow papers behind them 
L-E,Rain can can be used as prisms thats why theres a rainbow after it rains 
L-E,A solar panel absorbs light and uses it as energy 
L-E,Fireflies produce light from their abdominals because of a chemical reaction caused by Lucifer and Lucifer This is called photoluminescence 
L-E,This is how a glow stick works When you snap a glow stick it makes a little hole and to chemicals collide and then they glow This is called chemiluminescence 
L-E,A shadow is made by standing in front of a light source and then the place you block up is where the shadow is made 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the moon passes in between the sun and the earth causing a big shadow 
L-E,I thought glow in the dark could only happen with one thine but then I read Yasmin note and saw that it happens with three things heat friction and electricity 
L-E,In the shadows view I learned The closer the sun is to you the stronger it is 
L-E,Also I learned That your body blocked the sun and that creates a shadow The sun goes through the ground and makes a shadow for a root 
L-E,a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside 
L-E,We see a red rose because The primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off 
L-E,we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off 
L-E,A shadow is the darkness left behind when a light sours shines on a nontransparent object 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the moon blocks the sun light from coming to the earth 
L-E,A lunar clips is when the sun blocks the moons light from going to earth 
L-E,You can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain Rain is what make the rainbow in the sky 
L-E,Solar panels are panels that use light to make electricity 
L-E,All we see is light Without light we can not see 
L-E,To make a rainbow you need raindrops on plants then the sun shines on the plants then makes a rainbow 
L-E,You can make a rainbow by holding up a prism to the sun The white light will go through the prism and make a rainbow
L-E,The northern lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky They occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity to small for us to see 
L-E,solar panels take in the suns rays a make energy with them 
L-E,Lasers are the best wielding equipment that I no of because it saved the navy millions Laser is short for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation 
L-E,I think that light travels in a straight line because we did a lot of experiments and proved that it travels that way 
L-E,Light travels in a wave 
L-E,The rainbow makes white light 
L-E,When white light goes through a practicum it makes a rainbow
L-E,When white light goes through a rain drop it make a rainbow 
L-E,When you see a red rose the red light bonus into our 
L-E,When you see a yellow flower the yellow light bonus into our 
L-E,When you see colored light or a rose so if you a red rose red light bonus into your eyes but blue  green get absorb into the flower 
L-E,My theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line 
L-E,It is made when raindrops fall on something like a leaf and the sunshine shines through the leaf and the raindrop acts like a prism 
L-E,When we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow 
L-E,1 Is it true that all we see is light My theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes 
L-E,2 How do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque Opaque light bounces off it into your eyes 
L-E,Transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly 
L-E,Translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects 
L-E,Reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off And blue light hit it it would absorb 
L-E,If you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow 
L-E,How we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down The solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around 
L-E,How do out make a rainbow with a prism the white light goes in to the prism and it splits the light up into 7 different color s and those different colors are the colors of them rainbow
L-E,How you make a rainbow with rain rain acts likes prisms and do the same thing that prisms do 
L-E,How you see a yellow rose red and green are reflected and all the other colors were absorbed 
L-E,Water refracting light is when light goes in the water after light is in air the light is bent by the water 
L-E,An eclipse course when The Earth or the moon blocks the suns light 
L-E,A solar eclipse happens when The moon is between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the suns light 
L-E,A shadow is when light is shewn on a opaque object and the shadow is what is behind the opaque object 
L-E,light travels in all directions I need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else My theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight 
L-E,All we see is light 
L-E,if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed 
L-E,We belove that a rain drop can make a rainbow 1:1382

I observed that when we humans think of apples we think of juciey treats that are a beloved fruits. We don't think of the energy that is entering are body once we eat it. I know the apple enters our system of are body ready to digest after being chewed and swallowed. After it ids digested you feel like have more energy because you do. The energy flows around our body for a whlie then it comes out. My theroy is that the energy starts flowing throgh are bodys after 24 hours of digesting. My question is that why are apples diffrent colors yet they can grow in the sam place?

Plants get energy a little different than we do. Plants feed of the sun and soil, that gives them energy to grow fruits. We get energy from the plants fruits. Just like plants we eat and a little differently from plants... we poop out our food but do we poop out all of it? Im not shure what this part of your digistive system it is called but,I do know it seaves as a filter to filter out the bad and keep the good. I am wondering if the good stuff we keep is the energy we can use.

Leaves have things inside them called pigments which are colored red,yellow,orange and also, purple.You can't see them because during the summer there is so much chorophyll it overrides it. but during the fall there is less sunlight and the chorophyll slowly starts to fade and thats why the leaves change color.]"
L-EE,"All birds have feathers for different reasons. like the penguins have feathers to keep warm,chickens have feathers because they also need to keep warm, they also need them to flutter up to places only a few feet above the ground, turkeys need feathers also to flutter up to places and to keep warm. and penguins have a thick layer of blubber under their feathers to keep warm in the extreme cold"
L-EE,Before the BTB was blue because it had no carbon dioxide. Once we blew human air into it it turned green because human air has C02 . when we put a plant into the BTB it turned green because plants take in carbon dioxide and the plant took in the carbon dioxide and made it turn back to blue.
L-EE,"decompoition is in the naturle process by which large organic materials and molecules are broken down into simpler ones.
The ultimante products of decompoition are simple molecules such as carbon dioxid water. decompoition is actually an extremly vital ecological process."
L-EE,"decomposers and sravengers that break down the dead plants and animals . They also break down the waste [scat] of other organisms . Decomposers are very important to any ecosystem . If they weren't in the ecosystem ,the plants would not get the essential nutrients ,and then the dead matter and waste would pile up.
source:can't remember the title of the artical"
L-EE,"Decomposers are the F.B.I the F stands for Fungus, B stands for Bacteria and the I stands for Insects. Decomposers are like little cleaners of nature. They decompose until whatever they are decomposing into Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen &amp; Water."
L-EE,"First of all the cycle starts off as a seed. Then the seed gets carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, to grow. After it gets all of those things the seed turns into a small tree and grows out of the ground, this is when the tree also starts to grow roots. After this step the small tree turns into an apple tree, this is when the tree grows apples. After The tree starts getting weak it loses its apples. When the apples fall to the ground and die the seeds are exposed. They go back in the ground or the wind blows them away and moves them to some place else. This is how the cycle keeps on going."
L-EE,"I know that ants are decomposers. When they eat, they leave a trail of left over bits of food that add nutrients to the soil.
I know that ants are aggressive.
I learned that the ant population can impact the population of other species in an area. If the ant population goes down, other species in that area will go up.
[    My theory  - if an ant population goes up, other species'population will go down. Many ants work together to 'take out' other species.- ]    
[    A better theory  - without ants and other decomposers, the soil would not get nutrients. Without the nutrients inthe soil, the plants that grow there would not get what they need to grow strong with nutrients. Then, the animals that eat the plants won't have the best nutrients they need. Humans who eat the animals that eat the plants won't get the nutrients they need to get bigger and stronger and survive in healthy ways.- ]    
Ants are an interesting and important species.
[    I need to understand  - what are the nutrients in the soil that plants and animals and humans need?- ]"
L-EE,I learned that at first I thought that moss did not have any roots but now I found out that moss actually moss has tiny small roots and that moss is eukaryotic meaning their cells have nucleus that also contain cell wall called cellulose there also autotrophic which means they make their own food they also carry a photosynthesis witch makes carbon carbon dioxide into sugar. In order for moss to grow in other places there has to be other moss to send around spores. If it lands somewhere with the right temperature than it can grow correctly seedless plants are separated into different groups Vascular and nonvascular vascular have canals that carry water throughout their body. Nonvascular plants or bryophytes instead of collecting water from there roots they collect water though there thin cell walls they don’t grow more than a few centimeters tall. Thin rootlike rhizoids holds the plants down and also absorb water from the ground. You will find bryophytes all around the world mostly in rain forests and ponds and streams. Mosses are the most common bryophytes clumped in layers on tree trunks the ground or even rocks. Moss and liverworts were the first plants to live harsh places.
L-EE,"I used to think that not alot of insects can live in moss because moss insects are pretty big like a big ant, but there’s a insect called a tardigrade, a tardigrade is a insect that lives in or around moss, so if a tardigrade can live in moss, that mean other insects can live or can they because a tardigrade is microscopic so there’s a lot of space for the tardigrade, now i think that moss can’t really provide a home or insects because a ant lives underground, so if ants lives on moss, when it rain the rain will wash the ants away."
L-EE,I used to think that the air moves by itself now I know that the sun makes the air move and that the sun has to be in a certain area to push the wind it's the low pressure system as the warm air rises it cools of and eventually sinks back down the system is like a big engine taking in air all around it. That gets you a lot of moving air
L-EE,"I,ve Learned That All Living Things Are Linked Together By What They Eat. For Example, Say If There Were No More Shrimp The Amount Animals That Eat The Shrimp Will Start To Decrease And It Would Just Keep On Decreasing. Also Did You Know That The Food Web Can Contain Lost And Lots Of Animals In It? The Food Web Has Three Main Elements. Producers, Consumers, And Decomposers. Producers Are Plants, They Make Their Own Food Out Of The Sun, (Also Known As Photosynthasis.) The Producers Are Mostly At The Bottom Of The Food Chain. Consumers Can't Make Their Own Food So They Eat The Producers. Primary Consumers Are Herbavors, Secondary Consumers Are Carnivors, And Some Consumers Are Omnivors. (Also There Are Parasite Cosumers!) Decomposers Are Mostly Bacteria. They Help To Brake Down Dead Animals Or Dead Plants Or Any Of Those Dead Things."
L-EE,"Leaves have unique structures, called veins, that transport liquids and nutrients to leaf cells. Veins also carry the products of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree.
A tree leaf has several types of veins. The central one is called the midrib or midvein. Other veins connect to the midrib and have their own unique patterns.
Tree leaf veins in dicots (we also call these trees hardwoods or deciduous trees) are all considered to be net-veined or reticulate-veined.This means that the veins branch from the main rib and then sub-branch into finer veins.
There are two classifications you need to"
L-EE,"Like I said already in ""More about Moss"".Mossmaygrowonly on a north side of a tree if that's the shadiest location as the sun tracks the sky. Ifthereissomethingelse providing shade (or moisture), themosswillgrowin those places just as well."
L-EE,"Mosquitoes are part of the food web is because they get eaten by spiders,dragon flies and more. they are cosumers because they eat plants and obsorb the energy.But they get eaten by the animals thet I mentioned."
L-EE,"Not all plants have flowers or seeds. Ferns and mosses are plants, but they produce spores. Fungi or mushrooms also make spores, but they are not plants. Spores on ferns develop under the leaves. They look like brown spots, but you will need a microscope to see them. Each type of fern has spores of a different shape. Some plants reproduce without seeds or spores in a kind of cloning. Cutting, grafting, or bulbs can be used to grow new plants."
L-EE,"Parts of a plant
The blade is broad and flat. A stalk attaches the blade to the stem. A simple leaf has one bade and a compond leaf has several blades on the same petiole.
Veins in the leave carry food and water from the leaves to the rest of the plant. They also make a strong support that give the leaves its shape. The veins of a broad leaf form a netlike pattern. The veins of narrow leaves are parallel. ( leaves size are also adapted by habitat and maximize photosynthesis.)"
L-EE,"Photosynthesis occurs when a plant soaks up water through its roots, absorbs carbon dioxide (Co2) through openings in the leaves called stomata, and stores energy from sunlight as chemical energy. The water travels up the plant's stem through a transport tissue calledxylem. The water and Co2 spread through the leaves into cells calledthe palisades and the spongy cells. The cells are filled with structures called chloroplasts, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll splits the water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The sunlight chemical energy is used to create glucose from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The glucose dissolves into extra water molecules, and gives the plant an extra boost of energy that it needs to grow. The plant gives off the oxygen atoms as a waste product."
L-EE,"Photosynthesis starts off with the sun. When the sun is not blocked the sunlight goes to plants and gives the plants energy. notes:plants make carbon dioxide into sugar from sunlight, plants use stuff like air, H2O, Carbon dioxide, and sunlight to make there own food. When plans make there own food and ""eat"" it, they release water."
L-EE,"Photosynthiesis is where a plant turns energy from the sun into glucose for food. Meanwhile the roots suck up water and take in carbon dioxide, andreleases air as a waste product."
L-EE,"so what i learned is that photosnthesis is light tht comes from the sun and rain water and then it mixes it to gether and then creates this suger. but its not the suger thats in coockies, its a natrule suger. ill post a pickture about it."
L-EE,"The Blade, orlamina, is the broad, flat part of the leaf. Photosynthesis occurs in the blade, which has many green food-making cells. Leaf blades differ from one another in several ways: (1) the types of edges, (2) the patterns of the veins, and (3) the number of blades per leaf.
The Types of Edges.Almost all narrow, grasslike leaves and needles leaves have a blade with a smooth edge, as do many broadleaf plants, particularly those that are native to warm climates. The rubber plant, a common house plant, is a good example of such a plant.
The leaves of many temperate broadleaf plants have small, jagged points called teeth along the blade edge. Birch and elm trees have such leaves. Some plants havehydathodes, tiny valvelike structures that can release excess water from the leaf. The teeth of young leaves on many plants, including cottonwood and pin cherry trees, bear tiny glads. These glands produce liquids that protect the young leaf from plant-eating insects.
Some temperate broadleaf plants -- including sassafras trees and certain mulberry and oak trees -- have lobed leaves. The edge of such a leaf looks as if large bites have been taken out of it. This lobing helps heat escape from the leaf."
L-EE,"the food chain of the ants start with ants getting birth,then they eat ,then the chimpanzees eat the ants with their tools like sticks.then here comes a big predator called a jaguar then it eats the chimpanzee then here comes the the humans in africa eat the jaguar and leave it on the ground then it decomposes then it goes all over again"
L-EE,"wait hailey I think you are right but the spores are not only for the wind they are also for the moss to grow let me explain it to you:
As part of the first plant family to colonize Earth, the soft beds of mosses that now grace mountain streams and woodlands may have shaped our planet’s history.
Primitive mosses, similar to the hundreds of moss species found in Appalachia, might have triggered two cool periods around 455 million years ago, according to a recent study. Published earlier this year in Nature Geoscience, the study suggests that early mosses clinging to prehistoric rocks sped up the weathering of certain minerals from those rocks. The release of these minerals accelerated the pace of carbon sequestration, leading to cooler temperatures that paved the way for further plant and animal evolution."
L-EE,Why do animals mostly die in the winter and where do they go to hibernate if they do survive? I learned why they hibernate because it's cold and the weather through outside animals coming hunt for them so they have to hibernate swag so they have to get food and shelter before other animals do .A lot of website to find out what happened to animals is Google search the web and chrome it was the most places where you can go. Other animals eat the snow animals to get more energy for the night period every man for himself and animal from self again. Some animals hibernate some animals migrate.
L-EE,"Wolves don't have alot of predtors as you would think they do because wolves are usally in packs. Wolves eat most of the following animals. Elk, Ox, Rabbit, Moose, Beavers, Fish, Musk, and many more. The predtors of the wolves are bear and mountian lion. That's common predtors for the wolves"
L-EE,"Water onEarthcycles from the oceans, where it evaporates from the surface, into the atmosphere, forms clouds, falls onto the land as rain, travels through wetlands, rivers, lakes and underground then returns to the ocean — collectively known as the hydrologic cycle."
L-EE,"Humans impact water pollution in many ways-for one, the endless stream of garbage dumped into the ocean. A waterfall of plastic bags,cans, and water bottles are grinding into the beautiful sea life that surrounds our world. This pollution is usually the cause of the millions of sea animals that wash up on our shores, necks, mouths, intestines, and lungs entwined with plastic. Because of this, will dolphins become extinct?Manantee's?"
L-EE,"My question is: Where Does Water Come From?
[    My theory - is that water comes from earths core, the water then goes through the ground and goes to lakes, rivers, or oceans. - ]    
New info-Water onEarthcycles from the oceans, where it evaporates from the surface, into the atmosphere, forms clouds, falls onto the land as rain, travels through wetlands, rivers, lakes and underground then returns to the ocean — collectively known as the hydrologic cycle."
L-EE,"How Do Humans Impact the Water We Need?
Theyaffectthe quality of rainwater and ofwaterresources both above and below ground, and damage natural systems. The causes of freshwater pollution are varied and include industrial wastes, sewage, runoff from farmland, cities, and factory effluents, and the build-up of sediment."
L-EE,"Pollution In The Water
The main sources of water pollution are, Discharge of untreated Raw Sewage from households and factories, Chemicals dumped from Factories, Human littering in rivers, oceans, lakes and other bodies of water. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one of the main sources of pollution in the water. It is known for its many garbage and plastic.
Every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans. There may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean. Weighing up to 269,000 tons. In developing countries, 70 percent of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into waters, polluting the usable water supply. Polluted water can cause serious diseases some of these water-borne diseases are Typhoid, Cholera, Paratyphoid Fever, Dysentery, Jaundice, Amoebiasis and Malaria. Chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health. Pesticides – can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain.Each year 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into US water. While children make up 10% of the world's population, over 40% of the global burden of disease falls on them. More than 3 million children under age five die annually from environmental factors.“Approximately 40% of the lakes in America are too polluted for fishing, aquatic life, or swimming.” “Each year 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into US water.” Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land."
L-EE,"Water is essentially everywhere in our world, the average human is composed od between 55 and 60% water. So what role does water play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy? Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to cells inside our own bodies. Depending on the factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. At birth babies are even wetter. Being 75$ water, they are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday. So what role does water play in your bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn’t only in our blood. An adult’s brain and heart are almost three quarters full of water. That’s roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more closer to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much?"
L-EE,We can see a yellow rose because red blue and green are going to the flower Red and green bounce into your eyes but blue absorbs 
L-EE,You can see a red rose because red bounces of and goes into your eyes blue and green get absorbed 
L-EE,When you see a red flower the red light bounces off the flower in to our eyes and the green blue gets absorbed 
L-EE,When you shine a light through a glass prism it ell make a rainbow on the surface it needs to be white light of the colors light wail be to strong and wont split up into the rainbow
L-EE,This is how absorbing and reflecting works the colors that make the object will be reflected and the leftover color will be wasted not used 
L-EE,A shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream The light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark 
L-EE,A solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun It occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth The moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth 
L-EE,My theory is that light travels in waves I leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern Like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light 
L-EE,Most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light 
L-EE,a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger 
L-EE,If light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red 
L-EE,but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black 
L-EE,What is absorbing My understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white  Red Green and Blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed 
L-EE,What is Reflecting My understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed Why I think there reflected is because its not the same color 
L-EE,this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way 
L-EE,New information A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon Since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness 
L-EE,A solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what I just told you 
L-EE,The way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green What happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed 
L-EE,With a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray 
L-EE,The northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun The particles are so small you couldn't see them How they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow 
L-EE,Convex mirrors are used in stores They let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle 
L-EE,All we see is light the way I can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color Then the color bounces into your eye Three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color 
L-EE,I just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon The earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon 
L-EE,This is how rainbows are made with rain The sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow 
L-EE,I think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly 
L-EE,If you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface The color red is reflected But the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red 
L-EE,My understanding about a Lunar eclipse is that when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon The Sun casts a shadow over the moon called a lunar eclipse 
L-EE,My theory's that light travels in a wave line because if you drive behind a bus you'll see heat that looks wave 
L-EE,Shadows A shadow is an inexact reflection of your body that shows on a very sunny day when you are outside You see your shadow when you happen to be outside and you look down at the ground Also your shadow touches you wherever you touch the ground 
L-EE,We see a red rose when there is a flashlight or another light source that will shine on the rose and absorb the green and blue light and reflect the red light into our eyes 
L-EE,and how we see a yellow rose is that it is the same but the red and green light are reflected and blue is absorbed 
L-EE,How do you make a rainbow with rain The sky is still wet with raindrops and the sunlight shines through the drops and a rainbow forms in the sky Make a rainbow with a prism exactly the same way 
L-EE,The northern lights are also called the aurora Borealis and they are lights in the sky that are mixtures of colors that are seen only in the northern parts of the world and that is why they are called the northern lights 
L-EE,Why are Northern Lights different colors Each gas in earths atmosphere glows with its own color when it becomes charged with electricity Oxygen gives off an eerie green glow nitrogen glows red and neon gas turns pink 
L-EE,I also learned that a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun which makes a large shadow over the earth That is why when your outside and the sun dispersals its just a large shadow 
L-EE,I also learned that a lunar eclipse is caused when the earth is between the sun and the moon 
L-EE,Also if your looking at a yellow flower the blue light would be absorbed allowing the two other colors to both making yellow would bounce of into your two sensitive cone to those colors 
L-EE,The Northern lights are caused by the sun bombarding the earth with tiny partials of electricity When these partials hit the highest part of the hates atmosphere it electrolysis the air and makes it glow 
L-EE,To make a rainbow with rain it in voles moisture in the air and since there is moisture in the air the moistness acts like a prism 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is right in between the sun and the moon winch casts a shadow over the moon making the moon total darkness 
L-EE,Solar panels are used for sucking up sunlight and using the sunlight for something such as a solar powered windmill That works by the sunlight getting sucked into a solar panel and the light moves the windmill 
L-EE,A red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed 
L-EE,A yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon 
L-EE,Inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy This energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy The process of giving off light is called incandescence 
L-EE,You have three eye cones in your eyes One is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color 
L-EE,When we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose 
L-EE,My understanding of Light The colors of light Light is made up of many many different colors You cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light White light is transparent so you cant see it 
L-EE,When it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow 
L-EE,That is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow 
L-EE,There are also things called solar panels They are made to catch light The light that they catch is used to make electricity Solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected 
L-EE,A shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent When a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow 
L-EE,A lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun The sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness 
L-EE,A solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark 
L-EE,People make shadows by just standing in the light Because light travels in a titrate line or Waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object 
L-EE,Shadow My theory is that all the light gets around but it doesn't get past your body so it is dark and the shape of your body 
L-EE,A solar eclipse it happens when the moon is located between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the sunlight 
L-EE,Solar energy Solar panels are dark so they attract heat and the sun is turned into thermal energy In the panels there are little tubes and the water gets warmer the warm water is pumped into a storage tank and it heats the house 
L-EE,The Northern lights are red pink ghostly greens the Northern lights happen when the sun bombards earth with particles that are electric When they hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and it glows 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the moon and the sun in which the sun shines on earth and makes a shadow on the moon which makes the moon in total darkness 
L-EE,If a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower 
L-EE,but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when I did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights I didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow 
L-EE,There are two types of eclipses The rift one is called a solar eclipse Its when the moon goes in front of the earth and behind the sun which casts a shadow upon earth As I said before an opaque object like the moon and the sun is the light source it makes a shadow 
L-EE,this is how we see a yellow rose the white light hits the rose green and red are reflected and blue is absorbed why green and red are reflected incited of just one color is because yellow is a secondary color and are brain sees the rose upside down and backwards 
L-EE,Diffused reflection is when a ray of light comes and hits something like bumpy tinfoil The light comes and egos everywhere because it has more than one thing to bounce off of it It egos up down right left because when its bumpy it goes like that because of different bumps 
L-EE,Here is how solar panels work Dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light The dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy The thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan That means that black attracts heat 
L-EE,this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light The glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall When you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us These 2 things are all plugd into a wall 
L-EE,The picture I drew was making a rainbow out of a prism This picture is with two prisms this is how it works If you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again This is How to make white light through a viable spectrum 
L-EE,Also you can see a green object because white light shines on that object white light has red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet in it and the object absorbs all the colors except green which is reflected into the eyes of the person that is looking at the object 
L-EE,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the incident ray goes on the mirror and makes the angle of incidence There is an invisible line between the angle and ray of incidence and the angle and ray of reflection The reflection ray is the reflection of the incident ray 
L-EE,The Northern Lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky They occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity too small for us to see When these particles hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and make it glow 
L-EE,My theory's that light travels in waves because when we did an experiment with progesterone and a tennis ball hanging from the vealing on a piece of string And when we shone light on it the tennis balls shader was clear But the strings shadow had some light on it 
L-EE,Dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light so they are perfect for solar panels instead they absorb the suns rays and turn them into thermal energy this means that on a roof there are dark hoses of water  The water heats up because the hoses are absorbing the suns rays and they are isolated The heated water is pumped into a storage tank where it used to heat the house  
L-EE,When looking at a red rose you need light right You do so when your looking at that objetc the light shines on it and since it is red it refletcs the red light off the objetc and all the other colors get absorbed Its the same with any other color including yellow green etc 
L-EE,Shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object If the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror If there is no light there isn't a shadow So there is a shadow where the light cant reach 
L-EE,When we had the class debate I was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves And now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this Light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight That means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves It depends on how you look at it Or what your experiment is trying to prove In our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines Thomas Young experiment 
L-EE,The way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color The green light keeps going until it goes into your eye Then the brain identifies what color and it is 
L-EE,Cones tire easily If you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired So when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple And purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel 
L-EE,This is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order As you know there are seven colors that we know of They all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed But when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed For some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest 
L-EE,A thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights This happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun The sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic The earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow The colors that glow are red pink and green 
L-EE,1 How do you think light travels My theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going My theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines Like a flashlight That also explains why light is hot

When you eat the food, you chew it into a soft sphere that can fit down the esophagus. Once you swallow, your food goes down your esophagus, and lands in your stomach, where acids break down your food. Once that is done, nutrients are extracted in the small intestine. After that... you don't want to know. Once the sugar gets in your bloodstream, it goes inside your cells and into the mitochondria. There, sugar (by the way, it'sC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6) is mixed with oxygen to make energy (adenosine tri-phosphate, or ATP), water and carbon dioxide.</sub>

Humans get energy by getting food and water into their stomach. However, for the humans to get energy, the food needs to first grow. So let's take an orange for example. First, the sun will give energy to a type of plant. The plant will become a full-grownplant, and then things will start to grow on the plant. The things on the plat are oranges. Then, the oranges will be eaten by a human. However, the human first needs to eat the orange, and then the orange will need to go into the human's body. First, it will go into the esophagus(A "" tube"" that leads to your stomach. Now, the energy is in your stomach, but some of the food will continue to go through the small intestine, and the large intestine which will soon be digested.

The digestive system is the food processor that is in your body. To start the digestive system, you first have to eat something. then the food will go down your esophagus. The esophagus is a ""tube"" that goes through your throat. Once the food reaches the stomach, the food gets mixed with gases and chemicals. The food will stay here for a littlewhile until the next step of the process. Then there is the small intestine. That is the place where many of the nutrients from the food absorb. Juices from the liver and the pancreas also join the chyme in the small intestine. Then the digestive juices become into small moleculesthat will absorb into the bloodstream. Then eventually, after another process in the small intestine, the chyme will go into the large intestine. A large intestineis a place where many of the water gets sucked out the digested chyme. Thishappens the process named absorption. after most of the water is absorbed, the waste goes to the rectum. Finally, when there is enough waste, you go to the bathroom. This process usually takes 3-4 days. So, that'sis what the digestive system is like.

The digestive system is a very important system. There are many body parts involved in this systeem. The body part that does the most work in the digestive sytem is the small intestine. First, your stomach will make a squishy mixture called chyme. Juices from body parts such as the liver, and the panacreas will also join the chyme. In the small intestine, molecules are made. The molecules are made out of the nutrients from thr food that you ate. To make the molecules, the juices will help the chyme break apart. After the molecules are made, they will be brought to your vains. The molecules will absorb into the blood, which will take the molecules all over the body. The molecules go to body parts such as the heart. What about the rest of the waste, Parts of the food your body doesnt need will be brought to the large intestine. There, all the water absorbs out of the food. When there is enough waste piled up, its time to go to the bathroom.

The digestive system starts when you eat the food then it goes down your esophagus to your stomach, where acids and gases work together to break down the food. But, where do the gases come from? My theory is that they come from the acids, but that is only me. Once the food is broken down, it travels to the small intestine then more acids break down the nutrients even more, than the small intestine absorbs the food, and the nutrients travel to different parts of the body to provide energy, and the food that the body doesn't need goes into the large intestine which compacts the food together then the waste leaves the body. This whole process takes about 26-43 hours.

Each intestine has a different purpose. The intestines may seem like the same thing, but they each have a different purpose. The large intestine is mainly about where the waste is made, while the small intestine is more used for the nutrients so they can be brought to different parts of your body.
Small Intestine- The small intestine is one of the main parts of the digestive system. First, juices from body parts such as the liver will join the chyme. After that, In the small intestine the nutrients from the chyme will become into small molecules. The small molecules will be absorbed into your blood, and they will be brought to different body parts. Your bloodstream goes up and down your body, so blood goes to many body parts suh as the brain.
Large Intestine- The large intestine is where the waste gets ready to be released. The chyme is brought from the small intestine to the large intestine. After much of the waste is combined, the water will absorb out from the waste. When enough water is absorbed, it's time to go to the bathroom
Therefore, both intestines are very important, but they have a different purpose.

The muscles of the small intestine mix food with digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and intestine and push the mixture forward to help with further digestion. The walls of the small intestine absorb the digested nutrients into the bloodstream. The blood delivers the nutrients to the rest of thebody.

Molecules get to your brain by the blood stream in your body. In the Small Intestine, the chyme becomes into many little small molecules. These little molecules are small enough to be absorbed into your blood stream. The blood flows all over your body through these little things called veins. The blood will then soon go from your small intestine, to other body parts like the heart and brain. the molecules are little bits of energy, making the other body parts stronger. Therfore, your blood stream is how molecules get around the human body.

Obviously, their are many parts in your digestive system. However, which one is the most important? I mean, which organ of the digestive system does the most work? Well, that is a very hard answer. Okay, we can get rid of the esophagus right away. Why? Well, the esophagus brings your food to your stomach, but other then that, the esophagus really doesn't have a big part. Up next is the large intestine. The large intestine is important to, but not as important. The large intestine deabsorbs all the liquids in your waste, and also brings it to the anus. However, this organ still isn't the main organ in the digestive system. Ok, so we can technically go on and on about this all day. However, i'm just gonna type down the organs that don't have the biggest job, and explain why.
Appendix- no use at all (at least a rumor). May store good bacteria, but is unknown.
Gail Bladder- stores sugars, fats, and other items like bile to help break down your food. However,doesn't have actual use other then storage
Stomach- The stomach does churn the fod into chyme, and absorbs it. However, doesn't make energy
Liver- The liver filters all of the digestive tracts blood. The liver does have a very big part of the rest of the body, but not the most important organ for the digestive system. So important organ, but not as much for digestive system as the rest of the body.
Pancreas- The pancreas also is very important. The pancreas essential roll is to convert are food into fuel for our body, which is important. However, still isn't the most important organ in the digestive system.
Therefore, you mightv'e guessed that the most important organ in the the digestive system is the small intestine. The small intestine is a very important organ. Most of our energy is made in the small intestine, and it also brings the rest of our waste to the large intestine. So the small intestine is the most important organn in the digestive system. (Like you predicted).
P.S. If your body didn't have any of these organs, you would die.

When the food enters your mouth it goes down a tube called esophagus and ends up at a place called a small intestine most digestion in done there. Juices come out of the walls of the intestine what help break down the food into nutrients.

Esophagus- The esophaugus is a tube that goes fromyour mouth to the stomach. Food goes through the esophagus with the hep of your syliva. The sylivia helps the food go down the esophagus easier.
Small Intestine- The small intestine is a part of the digestive system that is very important. In the small Intestine, most, or all of the nutrients from the food are brough there. The nutrients brake up into pieces of molecules that are small enough to absrob into your blood stream. These nutrients are brought to other places including the heart, and the brain
Large Intestine- The large intestine is the place where your waste is made. All of the chyme first combineds together. Then a lot of nwater will need to absorb from the Chyme. When there is enough waste combined, its time for you to go to the bathroom.

We can break food up into to was Mechanical Digestion and chemical digestion.
Mechanical digestion is when you physically break the food apart.
Chemical digestion is when chemicals that are called enzymes breaks the food into molecules so it can let your body absorb it.
These types of digestion happens in our mouth. Chewing mechanically breaks apart the food. while that is happening enzyme in your spit called salivary amylase breaks down carbohydrates. When the food that you are chewing becomes a soft, gooey mass. That's when your tongue pushes that gooey mass to the opening of your esophagus, at the back of your mouth. Then your esophagus squeezes the food that you ate down into your stomach.  In your stomach food is churned and mixed with enzymes plus other digestive juices including hydrochloric acid. the chemical breaks down proteins and fats. In your stomach you have a lining of mucus protects your stomach from the acid. for about 4 hours the food that you ate turns into a thick milkshake and that is called chyme. The chyme goes into your small intestine which is not small at all it is 7 meters long. The small intestine is where most of the nutrients are absorbed from the food. In the first part of the small intestine which is called the duodenum. Digestive juices from the liver and the pancreas join the breakdown mix. The liver and the pancreas turn the chyme into a soup of molecules small enough to be absorbed into your bloodstream. In your small intestine, there are things call villi lining which is inside the small intestine.
This I makesme think that the digestive system is an important part of your body.

What I know is that the heart is made up of four pumps/chambers. Those pumps have an atrium and ventricle each. The brain sends a message to the heart to start pumping. The left atrium fills up with blood that is squeezed into the ventricle which then pushes the blood out which goes to the lungs for oxygen. At the same time, the right atrium fills up with fresh blood which is squeezed into the ventricle which is then pushed out into the body to help it circulate.

The heart is not only important becauseit helps us circulate it also helps us breathe.This is helpful because it the blood brings oxygen to the body cells and takes away their carbon dioxide. Although when we breathe out we release carbon dioxide. It does not get rid of all of it. So when the right atrium and right ventricle squeezes out blood to go to the lungs that blood removes that carbon dioxide. The blood does this by bringing oxygen with itself. The oxygen absorbs the carbon dioxide cells.

When the food goes into your mouth you swallow it after chewing and your esophagus pushes the food down to your stomach. It breaks down even more in your stomach. After about 4 hours the broken down food is like a milkshake and it is called chyme. Chyme moves into your small intestine. The small intestine is where the nutrients from the food is absorbed. The first part of the small intestine called the duodenum dugestive juices fromthe liver brake down the chyme. It breaks down into a substancelike soup. In your intestine thereissomething called villi andcells on the surface of the villi absorb the nutrients from chyme while the chyme is going through the small intestine. Then the chyme goes through the large intestine and it is thin and watery by then.

The digestive systemand trachea are very important. Let's start with the digestive system. First, the sun will give energy to a seed. The seed will grow roots, become a sprouting, a young adult, and then a full grown plant. After the plant grows, the sun and rain will give energy to the tree. The sun and the rain will make food grow. Foods like nuts, oranges, berries, apples, and seeds will grow. Someday, the food could be picked by a human. The human will eat the apple which will lead through the esophagus into the stomach. The stomachs sides are strong enough to grind the food. The ground-up food called chyme will go to the small intestine. Juices from the pancreas and liver will join the chyme. In the small intestine, the chyme will be broken apart. The nutrients in the food you just ate will be broken down into tiny molecules thanks to the juices. These molecules are small enough to absorb in your bloodstream. The rest of the waste will be brought to the large intestine. There, your waste will be all piled up. The water in the waste will absorb out of the waste. When there is enough waste, its time to go to the bathroom.
Next will talk about the trachea. Have you every drunk too much of a drink at once? If so, someone might say that it went down the wrong tube. As a matter of fact, it sort of did. The drink went down your trachea. The drink or food will make it jammed which will start to make you cough. The Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide are blocked in the lungs, leaving you to cough so the food or drink will get out so you can continue to breathe.
First, you start off with the sun. The sun will give seeds energy to grow. After the seed is a plant, the plant will release oxygen. Oxygen is the thing we breath in. It's not really called air because air is the thing around you when your outside. The plants produced oxygen will soon be brought to a human. The human will breath in the air which will go through the trachea. The trachea is a tube by your esophagus. The oxygen will be brought to your lungs a little or as long the lungs need it. When you breathe out, you are releasing a thing called carbon dioxide.

After your food is made into chyme, it will go into the small intestine. juicesfrom the pancreas and the liver will join the chyme as well. In the small intestine, the juices break the nutrients from your food apart. So the nutrients come from the food you eat. The juices break the nutrients into molecules so small that they can be absorbed into your bloodstream. Your bloodstream flows up and down the body so the molecules can get to different places. Your blood is brought everywhere in the body, so it will be brought to the body parts that need it the most. After a while, the nutrients will have reached the different body parts. Why do the nutrients go to the different body parts though? Well, the body parts need nutrients so they can be powered. Just think of a treadmill. A treadmill needs electricity to be powered. Without, the treadmill wouldn't be able to function. So whatI'm saying is without nutrients, your body wouldn't be able to function. However, why else do we need nutrients?

This is the motion that you do when you get a cuncussion when you don't hit anything. When you stop quickly at a red light in a car you could get a cuncussion. Your brain rocks back and forth and hits your bone protection, that is what causes a cuncussion.

Autism (AW-tiz-um) happens when the brain develops in a different way and has a hard time helping someone communicate and make sense of the world. The symptoms could be mild,sever or in the middle. Many kids with autism Have a lot of trouble knowing what emotions look like. Some symptoms of autism are Having trouble understanding the meaning of some words. Keep doing the same thing over and over. Move her or his body or arms in a certain way that might not make sense to you. Have trouble adjusting to change no matter how little.(Having a substitute teacher,having toys moved from their usual place or trying new food.) Imagine if you had autism. Trying to understand what your teacher is saying when you don""t know what he or she is saying.

If you didn't have those acids, the whole digestive system wouldn't function correctly and would cause not being able to absorb nutrients which would make you more lazy or tired or just sit around being half-hearted all day long. The acids break down more than before breaking down in the mouth for Chemical digestion but the acids are like the leaders of the stomach, they break down any food that is able to break down in to really small molecules that fit into the large intestine.

L-EE,"Well, you first might wonder why we need nutrients. Well, nutrients are very important. Nutrients have protein, grains, and vitamins that your body needs. Without nutrients, your body wouldn't be able to function at all. In other words, without nutrients, you'd be dead. Where do nutrients come from? Well, they come right from the food we eat. Some foods have more important nutrients, but all food normally has some sort of nutrient that is good for you. How do we get nutrients to other body parts? First, the stomach will make a think called chyme. Chyme is a squishy mix of your food. When the chyme goes to the small intestine, juices from the pancreas and the liver join the chyme. In the Small Intestine, the juices help break apart the nutrients from the food into molecules small enough that can be absorbed into your bloodstream. The molecules will then be brought to the body so the other body parts can get the nutrients. So nutrients get to other body parts of the bloodstream."
L-EE,[    My theory  - is you when you chew you breakdown the food 2 ways chemically and mechanicaly. mechanic breakdown is when you chew the food physically and chemical breakdown is when things in your saliva called enzymes helps breakdown the food then the food turns into a paste called chyme and gets pushed down your esophages into your stomach and your liver pancreas and gallblatter make acids to help break down the food so it can fit in your other intestines your stomach acids then it goes down duodenum and into your large intestine which absorbs more nutrients from the chyme and also water to make it more compact then it goes into your small intestine absorbs pretty much all of the nutrients and vitamins then goes into to your rectum and you go to the bathroom then it's done and this takes about 2-3 days. - ]

The person probably had Cerebral Palsy, a disease that may either effect your speech, movement, learning or vision. CP can effect most muscles in your body and the symptoms are very different, even the ones that just effect your legs! If your legs are effected you might need a wheelchair, you might need braces on your legs or maybe you walk on your own with no aids but the way you walk is different. CP is non-progressive, that means that it doesn't get worse or better, an example, if your CP effects your legs than later it won't effect your speech. CP can be caused by early birth or problems at birth but there are many ways to help people with CP and I mentioned one earlier, braces on your legs. You could also get surgery ( That wouldn't help your speech though ), get a computer if you have problems with speech of do phisical theraphy. I hope that you learmed alot about CP!!!

It comprises 60% of fat and is one of the fattest organs in the human body
Human brain has the capacity to generate approximately 23 watts of power when awake.
Of the total blood and oxygen that is produced in our body, the brain gets 20% of it.
When the blood supply to the brain stops, it is almost after 8-10 seconds that the brain starts losing the consciousness.
The brain is capable of surviving for 5 to 6 minutes only if it doesn""t get oxygen after which it dies.
The blood vessels that are present in the brain are almost 100,000 miles in length.
There are 100 billion neurons present in the brain.
In early pregnancy, the neurons develop at an alarming rate of 250,000 per minute.
As we grow older, we are unable to remember new things. According to the researchers in the US it is because the brain is unable to filter and remove old memories which prevent it from absorbing new ideas.

The heart is made up of two pumps one on the left and one on the right. The pumps are made out of Atrium and Ventricle, the Atrium brings blood back into the heart and pases it to the Ventricle which pumps the blood back out. This pumping cycle produces you heart beat, for example when the brain sends a signal to the heart, the right Atrium fills with used blood that's been through the body and goes through the body to prevent the lungs move oxygen. The left Atrium fills with fresh blood from the heart and lungs then ready to go back to the body. the Atrium squeezes blood into the Ventricle, below when the blood in your ventricle the valve between the ventricle and the atrium closes and the ventricle pushes the blood out of the heart, the right atrium pumps the old blood to the lungs. The left atrium pumps new blood to the rest of your body so it can circulate, it takes about l minute for it to circulate around your body and back to the heart to be pumped back out again.

Connected to the digestive system is the excretory system. The excretory system is the part of the body where urine is released. Let's start in the large intestine.  In the large intestine, water is deabsorbed from your waste. The water is absorbed in your blood which is brought to either one of your kidneys. In your blood, there is urea. Urea is something that could affect the blood. Other salts and waters are also brought to the kidneys. The reason that the blood doesn't keep the water and salts is because they can affect it, and your blood doesn't really need them anyways. In the kidneys, nephrons take these items out of your blood. All of these items are urine. The urine goes down ureters into the bladder. The bladder is where urine is stored. When the bladder is full, your brain will warn you it's time to go to the bathroom.

What the chemical break down does is it breaks down the food that you chewed but even more. It uses acid that the liver feeds it, and the acid tears apart the food in a way so it can go into your large intestine. After the two break down parts come the digestive part after the food breaks down in the stomach, it then goes through the large intestine/collin.

After brought down the esophagus, the food will be brought into the stomach. After that, their are enzymes that reak up sugars and fats from your food. These fats and sugars will then become a energy source called Adenosine Triphosphate, (ATP). Then, ATP will be brought through your bloodstream into your bodies cells. The cells will than make Adenosine Diphosphate, (ADP). Then the liver will store ADP, which is very important. Your body needs it to stay alive and strong. So thanks to the liver, our ADP is safe."
L-EE,"Everyone's human body has some sort of bad bacteria in it almost all the time. Bacteria can make you sick, or even worse... However, That's why we have drugs. Now, I know what you think. You think that drugs are bad for you, which is true. However, some drugs are good for you. This is called medecine. Medicine helps you from getting sick, and from allergies. Medicine that makes you feel well will make bacteria go away. Inside medicine, their are chemicals that makes the bacteria react in a differnt way. Your body to will also react differently. The chemicals wouldn't be good for the bacteria, so the bacteria would then be wiped out."
L-EE,"I do agree with you about how medicines can be dangerous. Like you said, medicine can be dangerous for you if you take the wrong type. However, like I said originally, some medicines are good for you. Today, We will learn abou how medicines can be good or bad for you. Like you and I said, medicines are good for you during certain times. Other times, they are not. Well, technically, all medicines are dangerous. If you take to much, you can get sick or die. However, when are medicines good? Well, if your doctor gives you it, you can have it. You shouldn't share your medicine with other people though. Well, I mean your personal medicine. If you bought a bag of vitamin drops however, they are a type of medicine good for more than just you. You still shouldn't share the vitamin drops though, unless your friend knows that the over counter medicine is good for them. How do medicines become dangerous? The answer to this is that medicines are dangerous when you dont follow the directions. If you give someone else your personal medicine, they can die. If you have to much of your own medicine, you can die. If you don't take your medicine, you can die. To prevent yourself from death, follow the directions. Do what your supposed to do, and if the medicine is complicated for you, please get some supervision.
Therefore, medicines are both good and bad for you. Like you said, all medicines are bad for you. However, medicines can be good for you to. They can make you feel better, and stay safe. That's all for now. Bye!"

L-EE,"The human body is a wonderous place. Their are many interetsing organs that are very special, but how is your whole body powered. Today, we will learn about adenosine triphosphate/ (ATP), adenosine diphosphate/ (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate /(AMP). Lets start with ATP. ATP is what 'charges"" your body. When you eat, ATP is made which than powers up your body. ADP, when made makes your body low ""charged"". The more ATP is used to transform into ADP, the less ATP you have. Than, if your body is low on ATP, it will be stored in your muscle cells. If the ATP isn't used, it's just stored in the muscle cells. ATP is actually your bodies main energy source. AMP is actually ATP, but AMP is when your body needs a sudden burst of energy. Say you were runing a marathon, and you were low on energy. Your stored energy will immediatly be released. ADP helps your muscle contraction. This means that ADP will help you move things around. ADP also helps you heal blood vessels.
Therefore, ADP hlps you move things around, ATP is your bodies main energy source, and AMP is instant energy.

L-EE,"Well, you may be thinking what sphincters are. Well, sphincters are things in your body that keep things like urine in a certain place. When many people hear the word sphincters, they think of the excratory system. every 10-15 seconds, urine is delivered to your bladder. To prevent the urine to go out, sphincters hold the urine in the bladder intil you go to the bathroom. The sphincters will then be pushed to the side of the urethra so the urine can be brought to the open world. In your case, when you drink soda, the sphincters that block of the stomach from the esophagus is opened every now so the soda can reach the stomach. If it all went down at once, your digestive system could be affected. If you need to burp, the sphincters will open letting the burp come up the esophagus. That's all for now. Bye!"
L-EE,"You are correct. But why does our stomach get upset. If you think it's stomach bug, it could be it, but what if it isn't. Well, lets leap into the body. Say you had a BIG meal. Then, after you finish it you start to have a stomach ache. Well, it is because of to much food (like you stated). However, why does this happen. Well, I honestly don't know this either, but I want to make a prediction. I predict that you get a stomach ache if you eat alot beacuase it's to mcuh food for it to handle. The stomach has to ""mix"" all of the food into gases or chyme. Yes, the stomach can just get rid of the food by the chemicals and gases in our stomach, but most of it is made in chyme. Plus, not much of the food even stays in your body. So, with more food, it puts more stress on the stomach. Then, the process could be slower, and the food would be sort of jammed, making you feel worse. If you really eat al lot, and you dont feel really good, you might throw up. That's all for now. Bye!"

Plasma is mostly water but also contains many protiens, minerals, and sugars used by the body to build and repair cells. Going all around the body, the plasma carries nutrients from the food that has been digested in the stomach and small intestine to the cells for use as fuel.

Blood plasma also helps to regulate the body's temperature, moving heat from deep within the body to the skin, head, arms, and legs.

Vomit is something that we do have for a reason. Like you said, it is from food poisoning sometimes. Food poisoning can cause you to vomit, but why? Well, if your food is poisoned, it will not be something the body is familiar with. The poison from the food will be affecting the body, which is not good. I predict you throw up to try to get rid of the poison. It could also be a reaction. For instance, if you touch poison ivy you can itch. So, if you eat poison the affect might be to vomit. you would vomit because the poison is affecting you. Jacob has taught me that if you have an allergy, you can vomit because the body thinks the food is poison. If you are allergic to things like gluten, and you eat it, the body might've never seen it. Therefore, the body would think thta it cant keep it. So then you would vomit. However, I got this info from Jacob, so ask him for more info. Like you said we also do vomit because of the stomach bug. When you get a germ, the germ has stuff in it that make you vomit.

When ATP is brought to a cell, mitochondria will come into action. It will break down all of the nutrition, and when it's broken down we will also have a new energy for the body to use. After that, the new energy is now ready to go. It can either be brough to a different cell to be stored, stay in the same cell and be stored, or finally it could be used immediatly.

My questions:
Why do we have a certain eye color?
How did we get the eye color that we have now?
Why do we have a certain hair color?
How did we get the hair color we have know?
What I have figured out about my questions so far:
We all have two genes that are color genes. We can have two different color ones, or two of the same color ones. If you have one brown gene, and one a different color, you will have brown eyes and brown hair, because brown genes are more dominant. If someone has brown hair, that doesn't mean that both of their genes have to be brown. If your parent has brown hair, and a brown and a different color gene, and your other parent has the other color two, then you could possibly have that color. You could even have a different hair and eye color than your twin if you have a twin!

The Eye is about the size of a ping pong ball and is located in the eye socket ( a hollow space in your scull) your eye lid protects your eye and keeps it moist. When you blink your eyelid is keeping the eye moist. You blink a lot, almost 28,000 times a day! Blinking is a involuntary and voluntary muscle. This means that you can blink when ever you want to, but sometimes you do it without even thinking about it. 
Another cool thing about the eyelid is that it has great reflexes. An example is when you step in to a bright room; your eyelids squeeze together to protect your eyes until they can adjust to the bright light . Another example is if you clap in front of your friends face there almost guaranteed to.

There are more than 25 trillion red cells in the approximately 5.3 quarts of blood found in an average 170-pound man. But the spleen and other organs usually destroy about 200 billion of these cells each day, giving red blood cells in the circulatory system a life span of only about four months. Red blood cells must there fore be produced at a rapid rate, inside the bone marrow.
Blood not only provides food, oxygen, waste disposal and protection from infection, it also closes minor wounds. It does this through the process of clotting, which prevents the body from continuing to lose blood and prevents sources of infection from entering the body. Clotting begins when platelets start to break up around the wound, triggering a series of chemical changes which produce a clotting enzyme. Once the body has begun to heal itself, however, proteins in the plasma dissolve the clots, keeping the blood vessels un obstructed and in good working condition.
