black ants live in colonies and anthills .black ants are mostly nice but not so aggressive like red ants and red and black ants mostly bite alot it causes a infection.Fire antsare omnivorous. Known toeatmeats, greasy and sweet materials.Fire antsare omnnivores, meaning they will feed on animal or vegetable sources offood. Thefireant worker's diet includes insects, earthworms, ticks, spiders, arthropod eggs, honeydew and other sweets.this picture here is a leaf cutter antThe ant is a very successful member of the insect group and has always been a topic of interest due to its complex colony. A profile on the ant explains the complexity of the ant colony and why it is often referred . The size and distribution of ant populations is presented along with information on the ant's senses and a detailed description of the ant's life cycle. Information on the ant's antennae is included as well as information on the ant's strength, walking paths, and social behavior.

"[    New Information  - Ants affect nutrients in the soil by moving through it to build nests and move food. This is good for the ecosystem. What is more important is the population of ants. When the population of ants decreases, the population of other species increases because the ants are very aggressive.
[    My theory  - The nutrients that the ants bring to the soil helps plants to grow.

"[    New Information  - bryophytes are actually a seedless plants. they do not need seed pollenaters or photosynthesis to grow. moss, liverworts and hornworts or all types of seedless plants. usally they live in wet and dewy habitats. this is how they grow.: A moss gives out seeds called spores that travel inair and lands onsome surface. the seed that lands on a surface will soon grow into a moss.- ]",L-I
"[    New Information  - that we found was that articles and videos might not be true.Which is why we need to do experiments. In the experiment we found out that the tounge is not made up with separterate taste buds in separterate areas. We found this out by taking Q-tips and dip it in 4 different subtunces sour (lemon Juice) Sugar,Salt and bitter (Coffee). Shown a diagram of different parts of the tounge and have to put the dipped in Q-tip on the part.You have to log it on a paper if you can taste it or not. In the end we shared our results and made a conclusion that the tounge is not made up of seperterate taste buds which means that not all article/videos aren't always true. - ]",L-I
"[    New Information that i have found is the leaves are green beacause of chorophyll. Chorophyll is green it absorbs the sunlight and water the help to make sugar for the tree.Plants use chorophyll to make food also. Leaves have things inside them called pigments which are colored red,yellow,orange and also, purple.You can't see them because during the summer there is so much chorophyll it overrides it. but during the fall there is less sunlight and the chorophyll slowly starts to fade and thats why the leaves change color.]",L-I
"I know that ants are decomposers. When they eat, they leave a trail of left over bits of food that add nutrients to the soil.
I know that ants are aggressive.
I learned that the ant population can impact the population of other species in an area. If the ant population goes down, other species in that area will go up.
[    My theory  - if an ant population goes up, other species'population will go down. Many ants work together to 'take out' other species.- ]
[    A better theory  - without ants and other decomposers, the soil would not get nutrients. Without the nutrients inthe soil, the plants that grow there would not get what they need to grow strong with nutrients. Then, the animals that eat the plants won't have the best nutrients they need. Humans who eat the animals that eat the plants won't get the nutrients they need to get bigger and stronger and survive in healthy ways.- ]

Why do animals mostly die in the winter and where do they go to hibernate if they do survive? I learned why they hibernate because it's cold and the weather through outside animals coming hunt for them so they have to hibernate swag so they have to get food and shelter before other animals do .A lot of website to find out what happened to animals is Google search the web and chrome it was the most places where you can go. Other animals eat the snow animals to get more energy for the night period every man for himself and animal from self again. Some animals hibernate some animals migrate.,L-I

"[    My theory  - is that rain comes into the mushroom, which makes the steam or smoke (what...)- ]
[    This theory cannot explain  - That mushrooms have no holes. - ]
[    I need to understand  - How it comes to there spores? Is it Moss?- ]
[    New Information  - about this, (from BrainPop), is that when spores (or something) does a thing called Budding, that makes it come off the mushroom (not really) this makes it (in my thinking) let the smoke come out when you flick it.- ]
[    New Information  - More info I have is that the mushroom is called the Puffball Mushroom.- ]
[    New Information  - (as of 12/6/18) They dont spur out steam or smoke.- ]
[    New Information  - (As of 12/10) The Puffball ISN'T A MUSHROOM. It actually is a fungi, but isn't a mushroom. (What?)- ]
[    New Information  - More, the smoke or steam is actualy DUST LIKE SPORES! So that means, that the smoke is actually SPORES, That look like DUST!- ]
I guess I found the answer to my theory!... or did I?
[    New Information  - I see that they get the spores out from getting Impacted (like the flick I saw at the Albany PineBush)- ]
I guess that's it...

"[    New Information  - Decomposition works when organic substances break down non-living, more simple organic matter (foxes, deers, etc.).

"Bigger animals in the food chain kill smaller animals but smaller animals can kill bigger animals. Say if there in a pack then they could take down a bigger animal.
I think fish don't need air to breath because they have some kind of organe in there body that lets them breath in water and have no need for air

science should real step up its game by doing other things.
The courtyard interactions the courtyard interactions and I have been focusing on is the apple tree changing during each season . is the tree dead? Will it have its leaves again?

"Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): The Endoplamic Reticulumis an extensive network of membranes composed of both regions with ribosomes (rough ER) and regions without ribosomes (smooth ER). The ER synthesizes proteinsand lipids.
Golgi complex: This organelle is responsible for manufacturing, storing and shipping certain cellular products including proteins.
Mictotubules: These hollow rods function primarily to help support and shape the cell. They are important for chromosomemovement in mitosisand mieosis, as well as cytosol movement within a cell.
Mitochondria: Mitochondria generate energy for the cell by converting glucose (produced by photosynthesis) and oxygen to ATP. This process is known as respiration.
Nucleus: The nucleus is a membrane-bound structure that contains the cell's hereditary information (DNA).
Nucleolus:This structure within the nucleus helps in the synthesis of ribosomes.
Nucleopore:These tiny holes within the nuclear membrane allow nucleic acidsand proteinsto move into and out of the nucleus.",L-I
