my theory i read a book and it said that if there were no moon there would be no waves is that true and if it was true why#L-QF
why do people need water#L-QF
this theory cannot explain i four water is coming from the ocean water that evaporates and later rains does rain water have salt in it too#L-QS
i need to understand why we can't just boil the salt out of the water and filter it also if the water is moving from the ocean to rivers to lakes and streams where it gets cleaned and drink ed then why can't we just take out the salt and clean the ocean water of couse then we would have to see how to get it to people in need but still why can't we just do that stuff to the sea water and just de el with it if it is clean it makes no sense#L-QS
i need to understand that why some people can get to water so fast and other people can't is it because those countries are hotter and water evaporates faster or is it because they don't have the technology that we have here and we have water pipes and other countries don't#L-QS
my question is that if it rains a lot in the rain forests then why doesn't it rain in the dry area's and also the world should try to focus mainly at trying to get food and water around the world to those in need my theory is that people are mainly focusing on how to advance technology and how to make a new way to do something easier that is already easy that's fine but we need to put most of our time and focus into getting food and water to those in need a better theory is that maybe if kids and younger people have to fetch water how about other people from around the world can make programs and help them and find more water#L-QS
i need to understand if you left something in soda for two weeks and if you left that same thing in water for two weeks what would be the difference my theory is that the one left in soda would be damaged while the one in the water would be perfectly fine glen summit spring water com the great spring water vs soda debate from glen summit spring link glen summit spring water com the great spring water vs soda debate from glen summit spring this link is a article about results of drinking water vs the results of drinking soda#L-QS
