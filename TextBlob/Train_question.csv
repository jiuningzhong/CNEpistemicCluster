[    The questions I have now are how do the molecules move from the small intestine to body parts like the brain?
[    What I know Is that the molecules go in veins from the small intestine, the question is how do they move through the veins. Many things normally move by the flow of air and water. Things don't get around a body by air, but A flow of something that moves around your body is blood.
[    My theory is that blood moves molecules around your body. Like I said, flows of movement often move many thing around. Also, blood flows up and down your body. So, there's a chance that the blood flows the molecules from the small intestine, through the veins, and up to the heart and brain.
