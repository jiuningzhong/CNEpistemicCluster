L-RS,The circulatory system of the lungfish is similer to most fish and maybe humans Its heart does the same thing that the humans do but it goes to the gills of the fish Plus each and every lungfish has different blood volume and preasure Of the small number of species of fish used in studies of the circulation only a few have been investigated extensively These include hagfish dogfish skate ratfish Port Jackson shark trout salmon carp tench cod lingcod eel and lungfish The data have been collected using a variety of techniques under a variety of conditions In some instances the fish were not intact and were either out of water restrained or anesthetized in other experiments the recordings were obtained from intact unanesthetized and relatively unrestrained fish The circulatory system is of necessity very responsive to changes in the environment the credits are from httpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiiS1546509808601296 LinkhttpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiiS1546509808601296 And I also used google scholar to find this info

L-RS,Evolution is the change that eventually happens over millions of years to better adapt to a habitat or environment change For example in the beginning of the world all the life was simply a few cells floation in the ocean Then they eventually adapted to ocean life by taking on the form of a axolotllike fishlizard Then they grew legs and lungs and came to land as an early form of lizards These adapted into dinosaurs Dinosaurs went extinct but many species of moles and mice These adapted into other animals and those animals adapted and that is how evolution basically works Here is a link to my slideshow I hope you enjoy it and learn from it It is for the Symposium so please do not write anything in it or delete anything Thank youhttpsdocsgooglecompresentationd1JrYC1Bpb6lbg9AJ1o22qPt2gzPHJ0h0h9U5ZzL8eMUeditslideidg5537d7c92f05 Linkhttpsdocsgooglecompresentationd1JrYC1Bpb6lbg9AJ1o22qPt2gzPHJ0h0h9U5ZzL8eMUeditslideidg5537d7c92f05
