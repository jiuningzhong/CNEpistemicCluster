[    This theory cannot explain  - That mushrooms have no holes. - ]    
[    I need to understand  - How it comes to there spores? Is it Moss?- ]    
[    New Information  - about this, (from BrainPop), is that when spores (or something) does a thing called Budding, that makes it come off the mushroom (not really) this makes it (in my thinking) let the smoke come out when you flick it.- ]    
[    New Information  - More info I have is that the mushroom is called the Puffball Mushroom.- ]

[    New Information  - More, the smoke or steam is actualy DUST LIKE SPORES! So that means, that the smoke is actually SPORES, That look like DUST!- ]    
I guess I found the answer to my theory!... or did I?
