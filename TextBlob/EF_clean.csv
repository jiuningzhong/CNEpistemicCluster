L-EF,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part
L-EF,lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth
L-EF,transparent means full se through so nontransparent means opaque non see through
L-EF,aura borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to france or italy the natives feared them because they thought they were evil things
L-EF,photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light fact over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence
L-EF,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head
L-EF,those are the colors of your eye cones what i mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the secondary colors
L-EF,the secondary colors of light are made by mixing the primary colors of light here are the secondary colors of light yellow magenta and cyan here is how their made
L-EF,the northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter
L-EF,a transparent object is something you can see though like stephanie light can go right though it
L-EF,a translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light
L-EF,when you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows and the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear
L-EF,if you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue violet and indigo
L-EF,my understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light
L-EF,lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day
L-EF,the law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray
L-EF,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle
L-EF,convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated
L-EF,i also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent
L-EF,another one of the things i learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time they could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow
L-EF,when light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point
L-EF,lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world it can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything
L-EF,when white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow all the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-EF,chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light i used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence
L-EF,making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out an example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle
L-EF,a translucent object is not see through that means that you cant look through it but a little light can come through a translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer
L-EF,a concave mirror has a sort of cave shape we have mirrors that are flat the mirror that i am talking about is that mirror but pushed in this mirror looks like a bowl when you look into it you see a long shape of yourself
L-EF,a convex mirror is the very opposite this mirror is pushed out this mirror looks like a belly as we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down
L-EF,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided the light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head
L-EF,lasers are very bright and very strong they can go through anything if you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop
L-EF,to make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light shine all of the colors in the same spot then you will see white light here is a picture to make it more simple
L-EF,light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens whits is called diffused reflection
L-EF,to make a rainbow withs prism is simple just get a prism and go outside then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow but sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-EF,co lours of light you can make white light by mixing red green and blue primary colors of light light together
L-EF,the secondary colors of paint are orange green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other
L-EF,there are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes they are red green and blue they are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta
L-EF,the gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point that point is the meeting place of the light
L-EF,your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness in a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright but at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between
L-EF,the angle incidents equals the angle of reflection
L-EF,a defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror
L-EF,you have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue they are all sensitive to there own colors
L-EF,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally
L-EF,you have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone the red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light
L-EF,we have 3 different eye cones the 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue
L-EF,a concave mirror looks like a bowl when light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below
L-EF,there is some thing called the law of reflection the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror
L-EF,a diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror its when all the light goes in lots of directions
L-EF,objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous the sun is luminous as well
L-EF,cones are things that respond to colored light there are three kinds of light that cones respond to red blue and green
L-EF,light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light a prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-EF,there are different names for the colors of light those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light there not just named orally the primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors
L-EF,the primary colors are red blue and green the same colors as your eye cones
L-EF,a convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave
L-EF,a concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite
L-EF,a convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you a concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close
L-EF,you can add another lens to one of those lenses also a double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light
L-EF,there are two kinds of light natural and artificial natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs
L-EF,the second thing is fluorescence that is made with friction like when two stones rub together they make fire whits is heat and light that is fluorescence
L-EF,news flash if you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed
L-EF,and umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source that makes a big shadow that is pretty darker
L-EF,a penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source that makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter
L-EF,eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down the image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize
L-EF,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it all the colors will come out the other side
L-EF,an umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra
L-EF,shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are
L-EF,the rainbow is made up of colored light the colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
L-EF,there are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue
L-EF,a concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and
L-EF,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large
L-EF,when colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light
L-EF,sundials are a form of telling time you can tell the time by the position of the shadow
L-EF,shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in
L-EF,a concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused
L-EF,a convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking
L-EF,the penumbra is the light part of the shadow its a shadow plus a little light
L-EF,the secondary colors of light are yellow magenta and cyan there made by mixing the primary colors of light
L-EF,about colors when you look at a red object for at least 10 seconds and then look at a white suffuse and it will have the same shape but it will be green
L-EF,eye cones are in are eyes and some are sensitive to red blue and green and if the red con is not working then you cant see any thing to do with red or red
L-EF,an opaque object is a object is an object that you cant see through like metal opaque objects are uselessly the strongest material
L-EF,a convex lens is a lens that consent rats the light beam so when you look at the sore it will be a dot
L-EF,thats the ope sit of a concave lens it makes the light sored out you so if your flash light wont sored out then you can holed up a concave lens to the sore of light and it will sored out and cover a larger area but with less power
L-EF,the angle of incidents equals the angle of reflection that mens if you shine a light sore on a flare mirror then the angle you shewn the light on the mirror is the angle it will reflect
L-EF,a concave mirror is a spoon like mirror if you walk away from it you mig is upside down but if you walk closer then its right side up
L-EF,most lenses focuses light so if a weak but large source of light is being produced and you put a lens under it then it will make the weak light focus and become strong
L-EF,you make a rainbow with a prism if you put a source of light in front of a glass prism you usably don't see a perfect rainbow mane not even a rainbow but sometimes you can see a small rainbow
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror
L-EF,there are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror
L-EF,but there are two more basic ones one is the concave mirror this mirror looks like a cave it goes in and bounces light inside it
L-EF,if a shiny thing like tin foil is there but bent the law of reflection doesn't work the light goes all over the place
L-EF,convex mirrors make your vision all you can see in the area bigger so if you look in a convex mirror you will see a lot more behind you thees are used in places like cars
L-EF,your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but i have had light near and it was dark because i was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think i have benn there long enough but with no light i don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room
L-EF,a shadow wilel appear when you are facing north your shadow wilel be in front of you if you are facing south your shadow wilel be behind you and if you are facing east your shadow wile be on your right and if you are facing west your shadow is on your left
L-EF,when two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball one shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object
L-EF,there are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only there is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was christian huygens the other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines and there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves
L-EF,the next view is the co lours of light view with rainbows a rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow you can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-EF,thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks one of these sources is wintergreen life savers if you are chewing one turn the lights of look in a mirror while chewing look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks
L-EF,they also have something called the law of reflection the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection to clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle
L-EF,but first natural light there are two sections that i am going to write about first photoluminescence photoluminescence is made from a living thing like electric sale they make their own light therefore electric sale are electroluminescent so are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi
L-EF,we did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows first we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows
